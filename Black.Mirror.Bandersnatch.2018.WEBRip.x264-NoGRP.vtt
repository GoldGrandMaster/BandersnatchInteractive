Breakfast?

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.680
Here's your tea.

5
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.680
"Thanks, Dad."

6
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.320
Sorry. Sorry, I was miles away.
Got to get everything ready for today.

7
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.040
This with some computer people?

8
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.960
Yeah. Tuckersoft.
They do Colin Ritman's games.

9
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.560
Oh, not<i> the</i> Colin Ritman.

10
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.160
Mr. Thakur, the owner,

11
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.840
said I could show them
my Bandersnatch demo.

12
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.840
- Your Bander-what?
- Bandersnatch.

13
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.920
I've based it on the book.

14
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.600
Was that your mother's?

15
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.240
It was in her things, yeah.

16
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.400
- Don't know if she read it though.
- Don't think so.

17
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.000
"Jerome F. Davies."

18
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.320
Well, he can't be a great writer.

19
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.280
You're always flicking backwards
and forwards in that.

20
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.120
No, it's a "Choose Your Own Adventure"
book.

21
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.440
You decide what your character does.

22
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.120
- You know, like a game.
- Sounds thrilling.

23
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.880
How about you decide
what you want for your breakfast?

24
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.400
Both seem a bit kiddywink to me,
but you will insist.

25
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.840
Oi!

26
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.640
Get back next door!

27
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.400
The bloody hound from next door.

28
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.640

29

Alright, fetch us 20 B&H, would you?
And... Lion bar.

37
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.160
Good boy.

38
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.080
Ah!

39

You... are... Steven.

40
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.040
- Stefan.
- Stefan, sorry, mate.

41
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.400
That's alright. I get it all the time.

42
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.640
Sorry about the chaos.
We just moved in Monday.

43
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.480
It's big.

44
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.040
Well, expansion, that's my plan.

45
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.680
Imagine, OK.
A whole team just for graphics,

46
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.080
another for sound, for gameplay.

47
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.840
We're going to be a hit factory.

48
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.400
Like Motown but for computer games.

49
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.160
You heard it here first.

50
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.160
That's Colin's new one.

51
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.640
- Colin Ritman?
- That's him over there.

52
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.880
That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

53
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.040
Let's say hello.

54
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.840
- Sure he won't mind? He's working.
- He'll be fine. He'll be fine. Shh! Shh!

55
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.160
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.

56
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.440
What's this, Kajagoogoo?

57
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.880
You wish.

58
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.240
The state of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini

59
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.560
and he still smokes roll-ups.

60
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.720
Well, pre-rolled has strychnine in them,
so the joke's on him.

61
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.520
Anyway, this is Stefan, er...

62
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.840
Butler, Butler.

63
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.320
I'm Colin, yeah?

64
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.640
Yeah, I've played all of your games.
All of them.

65
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.320
Except the Commodore ones,
I don't... don't have a Commodore.

66
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.360
- Great sound chip, the Commodore.
- Mm-hm.

67
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.280
Yeah.

68
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.200
This is my latest.

69
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.600
It's called Nohzdyve.

70
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.240
- The sprites are so smooth.
- That took some doing.

71
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.440
Oh, bollocks.

72
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.240
- What's that?
- It's a buffer error.

73
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.920
The eyeballs have overrun
the video memory...

74
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.680
Oh, yeah, video memory, yeah.

75
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.160
I was going to say that.

76
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.240
Anyway, listen,
let's get down to business.

77
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.600
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

78
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.920
Bloody hell.

79
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.640
So it's like 3D Monster Maze?

80
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.040
Only when you're moving
from choice to choice.

81
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.120
- It's actually an adventure game.
- Like<i> The Hobbit?</i>

82
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.280
Yeah, but...

83
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.200
without any typing.

84
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.240
Without any typing?

85
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.120
So no "get lamp" or whatever?

86
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.600
That's right.

87
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.440
Choices come up on the screen
and you pick one against the clock.

88
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.560
OK, he's Pax, he's the demon.
He's in the book.

89
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.440
So we've actually arrived
at a choice point,

90
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.360
and then you can choose with the joystick.

91
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.200
You've got ten seconds.

92
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.600
Worship him.

93
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.880
No, don't do that,
he's the Thief of Destiny...

94
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.320
in the book, I mean.

95
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.840
Got a copy of this at home.
Never got around to reading it.

96
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.840
You should.
Jerome F. Davies was a genius.

97
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.560
Didn't he go bonkers
and cut his wife's head off?

98
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.880
- Yeah, but, I mean, apart from that...
- Excuse me.

99
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.160
What's happened?

100
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.520
Well, I haven't programmed
that pathway yet.

101
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.560
Lot of paths then?

102
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.920
Well, yeah,
if it's going to be like the book.

103
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.560
So, come on.
How do you want to go about this?

104
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.520
- You're... you're interested?
- That's what I'm saying.

105
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.240
OK, it's July now,
so if we want to hit Christmas,

106
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.320
then we'll need the tapes in Smiths
by November.

107
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.080
OK. So here's my proposal.

108
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.760
Come and write it here.

109
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.080
- Here?
- Yeah!

110
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.840
We'll give you a couple of desks,
set up a small team, just for you.

111
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.880
And of course Col's on hand.

112
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.600
What do you reckon?

113
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.280
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

114
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.080
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

115
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.560
So, come on. What's your answer?

116
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.960
Yes.

117
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.440
Perfect. Perfect.

118
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.720
OK, so the first thing we need to do
is streamline the project a little.

119
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.720
We can't fit a breeze block
of a book into 48K.

120
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.080
Oh, look at this.

121
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.440
Here you go.

122
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.760
Happy Birthday to me.

123
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.080
Sorry, mate. Wrong path.

124
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.200
<i>The next game under our</i>
<i>Christmas spotlight is Bandersnatch,</i>

125
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.840
<i>in which the player navigates</i>
<i>a shifting timeline of parallel realities,</i>

126
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.640
<i>based on the book of the same name</i>
<i>by Jerome F. Davies.</i>

127
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.520
<i>That's how Bandersnatch works,</i>
<i>but did it "snatch" your respect?</i>

128
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.040
<i>I'm afraid not, Leslie,</i>

129
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.600
<i>for the simple reason</i>
<i>that it's just way too short.</i>

130
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.240
<i>It's over before it's even begun.</i>

131
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.320
<i>This is the one of the first team-created</i>
<i>games from Tuckersoft,</i>

132
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.880
<i>and I think that's given it</i>
<i>a very designed-by-committee feel,</i>

133
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.680
<i>almost like they just rushed out</i>
<i>the simplest, quickest cash-in they could.</i>

134
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.920
<i>What they should've done</i>
<i>is just gone right back to the start</i>

135
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.840
<i>and tried again.</i>

136
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.160
- <i>And your verdict?</i>
<i>- No stars out of five. Terrible.</i>

137
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.160
<i>Oof, well, maybe next week</i>
<i>we'll have something more for you...</i>

138
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.240
That kid knows nothing.

139
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.320

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.520

this year to buy a Lamborghini

152
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.040

Buffer error.

158
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.560

- Just did.
- Bloody hell, he's good, right?

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.960

Stefan's got something to demo for us.

162
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.360
You choose with the joystick.
See. You've got ten seconds.

163
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.760
Don't worship him,
he's the Thief of Destiny.

164

- Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

165

Isn't he that bloke who went cuckoo
and cut his wife's head off?

166
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.160
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

167
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.760
Which ending did you get?
When you read it.

168
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.360
- All of them.
- Excuse me.

169
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.560
- What's happened?
- I haven't programmed that path yet.

170
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.920
Right. So a lot of paths then?

171
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.520
Well, yes,
if it's going to be like the book.

172
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.320
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

173
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.480
It was ahead of its time.
In as much as time exists.

174
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.040
OK. So here's my proposal.

175
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.720
Come and write it here.

176
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.680
- Here?
- We'll give you a couple of desks,

177
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.600
set up a small team, just for you.
And of course Col's on hand.

178
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.440
What do you reckon?

179
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.040
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

180
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.440
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

181
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.200
So, come on. What's your answer?

182
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.960
No.

183
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.520
I mean, yes,
I want to do your game, but I-I just...

184
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.400
I just think I need-I need to...

185
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.800
I need to write it how I know.

186
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.200
You know, just me. At home.

187
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.560
At home. On your own?

188
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.480
Yeah, it's just that it's all in my head,

189
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.840
and I think if I let other people in
it'll just get, I don't know, stressy?

190
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.440
"Stressy"?

191
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.240
But I know
that I can do it proper justice.

192
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.480
The book.

193
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.280
You know, divergent story paths.
Parallel realities.

194
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.040
- It's still a game though, yeah?
- I get it.

195
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.000
The lad's a craftsman.

196
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.760
He's a lone woodsman. I'm the same.

197
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.920
- Yeah, but...
- It's like I say,

198
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.520
teams are fine for things
like action titles,

199
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.320
but when it's a concept piece,

200
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.240
bit of madness is what you need
and that works best when it's one mind.

201
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.040
Alright, Timothy Leary, we'll debate
<i>The Doors of Perception</i> later...

202
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.600
That was Huxley not Leary.

203
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.760
If you're going to write this
on your tod, the important thing is

204
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.520
putting it out for Christmas, so I'll need
finished code by 12th September.

205
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.640
- OK, sure.
- But no later.

206
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.480
What do you listen to?

207
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.040
- Hmm?
- To get in to the flow.

208
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.240
Oh, music?

209
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.920
Er... Thompson Twins.

210
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.480
Get a pen.

211
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.520
I'm defrosting mince.

212
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.240
It's like alien technology, this thing.

213
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.440
Oh. How... How did it go?

214
00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.520
Er, good. Yeah, really good.

215
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.320
- They're taking it.
- Oh, well, that's great, isn't it?

216
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.040
- Well done, mate.
- You've got mince juice on your hands.

217
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.320
Yes.

218
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.520
So, how does it work then?
Do you go into their office, or...?

219
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.960
No, I write it here.

220
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.640
- On-on your own?
- Yes.

221
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240
And...

222
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.280
Is that the best way
to work on something like this?

223
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.480
Why wouldn't it be?

224
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.200
<i>Well, the graphics</i>
<i>are certainly impressive, Robin,</i>

225
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.120
<i>but the big question is,</i>
<i>what's it like to play?</i>

226
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.560
<i>Well, the gameplay is just as impressive.</i>

227
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.320
<i>I must say, this is a Colin Ritman game,</i>
<i>so we'd expect little else,</i>

228
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.200
<i>but even by his standards</i>
<i>this is really most impressive.</i>

229
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.080
<i>It's challenging,</i>
<i>there's quite a big learning curve,</i>

230
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.240
<i>so you die a lot and have to try again</i>
<i>but I didn't really mind that much.</i>

231
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.200
<i>So it sounds great</i>
<i>but what's your verdict, Robin?</i>

232
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.040
<i>Four stars out of five.</i>
<i>Colin Ritman does it again.</i>

233
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.120
- <i>So not quite perfect.</i>
<i>- </i>Well, nothing's perfect.

234
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.120
So there I am, there's Colin Ritman...

235
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.040
"The actual Colin Ritman,"
I believe you called him.

236
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:21.000
Yeah, exactly. And Mr. Thakur's
offering me the chance to work there

237
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
in their own office alongside Colin.

238
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.240
And I just...

239
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.240
- I don't know. It was too...
- Too?

240
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.920
Good to be true.

241
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.520
- I said no.
- You said no?

242
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.880
Well, not to the whole thing,

243
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.800
just to working there,
being under their control.

244
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.320
I don't know where it came from,
I just said no

245
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.000
and then had to justify it
by saying that I prefer to work alone.

246
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.600
But I just don't know
where the urge to say it came from.

247
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.040
It sounds like you're growing
in confidence. I think it's a good sign.

248
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.000
Well, they're still letting me
do the game, so...

249
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.520
Well done, Stefan. That's great.
That's great.

250
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.720
You sound like my dad.

251
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.640
Oh.

252
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.800
Sorry.

253
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.600
He gets on my nerves sometimes.

254
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.240
Like this... I'm fine now,

255
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.200
I don't see why I need
to keep coming to these sessions.

256
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.360
It just feels like being...
I don't know, monitored.

257
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.360
Perhaps you're feeling intruded upon
because of the anniversary looming.

258
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.040
It's a difficult time of year for you.
We can't underestimate that.

259
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.280
Would you like to talk about what
happened with your mother?

260
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:03.360
It can be helpful to revisit things.
Even if you feel you've done this before.

261
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.960
You might discover something new.

262
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.400
I keep thinking about that morning.

263
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.360
Reliving it.

264
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.280
<i>Rabbit.</i>

265
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.480
<i>It was because of Rabbit.</i>

266
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.640
<i>He was this stupid toy that my mum</i>
<i>had made for me when I was born.</i>

267
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.200
I used to take him everywhere.

268
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.600
I think Dad thought it was sissy
or something.

269
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.440
<i>He and Mum used to</i>
<i>have these rows about it.</i>

270
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.560
By five, he should've
stopped playing with dolls.

271
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.000
<i>I know he took rabbit away</i>
<i>and hid it somewhere.</i>

272
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.080
<i>That morning, Mum was going</i>
<i>to visit Granddad and Grandma.</i>

273
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.920
<i>I was supposed to be going with her,</i>
<i>but I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.</i>

274
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.960
<i>And I refused to go without him.</i>

275
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.800
Come on, Stefan, we're going to be late.

276
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.080
Are you coming or not?

277
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.200
No!

278
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.480
Come on.
You'll have to catch the 8:45, now.

279
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.000
<i>So I held her up.</i>

280
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.240
<i>Because of me she had to catch</i>
<i>a later train. Because of me.</i>

281
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.720
Stefan, how old were you
when this happened?

282
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.440
Five.

283
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.640
You were five years old.

284
00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.520
And you couldn't have known.

285
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.720
Stefan.

286
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.640
You couldn't have known.

287
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.320
<i>The Emergency Services say</i>
<i>the 8:45 train derailed</i>

288
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.800
<i>at high speed</i>
<i>outside Queenstown Road Station.</i>

289
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.560
<i>As the death toll continues to rise,</i>
<i>transport police have opened an inquiry,</i>

290
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.040
<i>but the cause is not yet clear.</i>

291
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.760
I fucking hate him for it.

292
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.840
The past is immutable, Stefan.

293
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.800
No matter how painful it is,
we can't change things,

294
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.800
we can't choose differently,
with hindsight.

295
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.840
We all have to learn to accept that.

296
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.280
Remember, any time you need me,
just pick up the phone.

297
00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.240
You know the number.

Thank you.

305
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.520
Stefan?

306
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.320
Um, tea.

307
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.520
Er, look, I'm going to go to the pub
for some lunch.

308
00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.440
- If you fancy tagging along.
- No. I'm alright.

309
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:05.680
- You didn't have any breakfast.
- Dad, I'm fine.

310
00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.160
Is everything alright?

311
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.840
Stefan, I'm worried about you.
You've been stuck in your room for weeks.

312
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.080
Stefan?

313
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.200
Will you talk to me?

314
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.960
Look, I can't help if you just sit there
and don't speak!

315
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.680
Stefan, what the hell are you doing?
That's all your work!

316
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.040
Is everything alright?

317
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.800
Stefan, I'm worried about you.
You've been stuck in your room for weeks.

318
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.720
Stefan?

319
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.960
Will you talk to me?

320
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.880
Look, I can't help if you just sit there
and don't speak!

321
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.720
Dad, just fuck off!

322
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.480
I'm sorry.

323
00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.760
I'm... I'm just...

324
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.240
- I'm-I'm just stressed.
- Get your coat.

325
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.760
We're going for lunch.

326
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.440
- Dad. I need to finish this.
- And we'll go in the car.

327
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.040
<i>♪ We're only making plans for Nigel ♪</i>

328
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.880

329
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.360
We're here.

330
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.200
This is Dr. Haynes' place.

331
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.720
- You said we were getting lunch.
- You need to speak to her.

332
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.880
You're under pressure, you're...

333
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.520
You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

334
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.480
I'm concerned about you, OK?

335
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:09.080
I think the healthiest thing to do
is to talk about any concerns you may have

336
00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.400
instead of bottling them up inside.

337
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.680
Don't know if it's the deadlines,
but my head is all over the place.

338
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.160
I keep having these vivid dreams.
Like thinking weird things.

339
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.480
What sort of things?

340
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.160
- Like I'm not in control.
- Of?

341
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.240
Anything, little things, tiny decisions.

342
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.720
What I have for breakfast in the morning.
What music I listen to.

343
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.600
Whether I shout at Dad, or...

344
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.760
You feel like you're not making
these decisions?

345
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.680
I feel like I'm not guiding them.
Like someone else is.

346
00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.520
You're not hearing voices or...?

347
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.880
No voices, but there is something.

348
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.080
I-I don't know, an impulse.

349
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.480
I'm sure there is.

350
00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.960
OK. The fact that you're aware
of your mental state

351
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.320
is actually reassuring.

352
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.440
But it sounds like you're starting
to dissociate

353
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.960
so we want to nip that in the bud

354
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.640
before you start
to seriously entertain delusions.

355
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.600
I don't think we're there yet though.

356
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.040
We can't overlook the fact

357
00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.240
that the anniversary
of your mother's death is due,

358
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.120
and as we know, that's a stressor.

359
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.840
Ah!

360
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.200
With that in mind,

361
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.960
I think it's important that you stay
on the pharmaceutical path

362
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.360
at least for the next few months.

363
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.280
I'm upping the dosage slightly.

364
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.960
Stefan.

365
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.080
Don't see this as a setback.

366
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.280
You're not alone. We're in it together.

367
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.640
One for all, and all...

368
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.840
For one.

369
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.040
If anything happens, just call me.

370
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.320
You know the number.

371
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.520
- How was it?
- It was fine.

372
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.800
<i>So, Bandersnatch. Worth it?</i>

373
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.280
<i>I wish I could say yes</i>
<i>but it's frustrating.</i>

374
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:42.600
<i>It's as if the creator simply gave up</i>
<i>halfway through and went on autopilot.</i>

375
00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.280
<i>If we had second chances in life,</i>
<i>I'd hope they'd choose differently</i>

376
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.440
<i>but, er, sadly we don't.</i>

377
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.320
<i>And nor do they. If that makes sense?</i>

378
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.080
- <i>So your verdict?</i>
<i>- Two and a half stars out of five.</i>

379
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.360
<i>Disappointing.</i>

380
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.520
<i>Oh, dear. Well, maybe next week</i>

381
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.800
<i>we'll have something more</i>
<i>to float your boat, Robin.</i>

382
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.080
I should try again.

383
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.680
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

384
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.200
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

385
00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.600
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

386
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.040
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

387
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.320
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

388
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.880
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

389
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.240
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

390
00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.720
Looking good.

391
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.840
Good job I doubled the advertising.

392
00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.400
That's not...

393
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.480
Stefan, mate. This is due today.
You said it was stable.

394
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.360
- It was, I just...
- Just what?

395
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.440
- Did you add a new path?
- The government conspiracy branch.

396
00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.000
One of the alternate timelines
in the novel.

397
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.480
Jerome F. Davies
was into his conspiracy theories.

398
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.040
- Before or after he went psycho?
- I thought I'd tied up all the loose ends.

399
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.800
If it's something you've added,
let's just take it out.

400
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.200
- No, it's important.
- Stefan, mate. The deadline is today.

401
00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.240
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path in.

402
00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.760
- Oh, it's complicated enough.
- Just the weekend. Please.

403
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.120
- First thing Monday.
- First thing.

404
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.240
Okay.

405
00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.160
Shit, I've got to run,
meeting the John Menzies guys.

406
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:41.720
Just don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

407
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.800
I know.

408
00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.880
Here. That's for you.

409
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.720
What is it?

410
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.600
Taped it off the telly.
Documentary about Jerome.

411
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.160
A bit of inspiration maybe.
Pop it on while you work.

412
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.400
Are you having a film night?

413
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.960
<i>Sugar Puffs from Quaker.</i>

414
00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.480
<i>Tell them about the honey, yummy.</i>

415
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.960
<i>Towards the end of his life,</i>

416
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.320
<i>Davies was apparently self-administering</i>
<i>hallucinogens on a daily basis.</i>

417
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.680
<i>This, coupled with his attempts</i>

418
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.880
<i>to complete the complex multiple</i>
<i>narratives of</i> Bandersnatch

419
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.080
<i>was to prove the final straw.</i>

420
00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.840
<i>He became obsessed</i>
<i>with bizarre symbols</i>

421
00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.280
<i>and the limitations</i>
<i>of his own free will.</i>

422
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.400
<i>In his notes,</i>
<i>Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph</i>

423
00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.840
<i>which to him represented multiple fates,</i>
<i>potential realities splitting in two.</i>

424
00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.720
<i>It was the start</i>
<i>of his complete mental collapse.</i>

425
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.240
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate</i>

426
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.640
<i>because his wife was spiking him</i>
<i>with psychoactive drugs</i>

427
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.160
<i>at behest of a demon called Pax,</i>
<i>a sort of lion figure</i>

428
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.680
<i>who he claimed he'd seen in a vision,</i>

429
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.800
<i>and who ended up</i>
<i>being incorporated into the book.</i>

430
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.240
<i>It was this that led him to kill her.</i>

431
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.640
<i>He decapitated her and daubed the</i>
<i>glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.</i>

432
00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.840
<i>After his arrest, he told police</i>

433
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.280
<i>we exist within</i>
<i>multiple parallel realities at once.</i>

434
00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.720
<i>One reality for each possible course</i>
<i>of action we might take in life.</i>

435
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.720
<i>Whatever we choose to do</i>
<i>in this existence,</i>

436
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.000
<i>there’s another one out there</i>
<i>in which we’re doing quite the opposite,</i>

437
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.920
<i>which renders free will meaningless.</i>
<i>Nothing but an illusion.</i>

438
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.760
<i>If you follow that line of thinking</i>
<i>to its logical conclusion...</i>

439
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.360
<i>...they're not even your actions.</i>

440
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.640
<i>Your fate has been dictated,</i>
<i>it's out of your hands.</i>

441
00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.480
- <i>You're just a puppet.</i>
- Shh, shh, shh.

442
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.640
<i>You're not in control.</i>

443
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.760
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

444
00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.320
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

445
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.520
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

446
00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.160
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

447
00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.400
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

448
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.000
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

449
00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.240
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

450
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.080

<i>If you follow that line of thinking</i>
<i>to its logical conclusion,</i>

460
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.160
<i>then you're absolved of any guilt</i>
<i>from your actions.</i>

461
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.680
<i>But they're not even your actions.</i>

462

<i>Your fate has been dictated,</i>
<i>it's out of your hands.</i>

464
00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.920
<i>So, why not commit murder?</i>

465
00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.640
<i>Maybe that's what destiny wants.</i>

466
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.320
<i>You're just a puppet.</i>

467
00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.280
<i>You're not in control.</i>

468
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.680
<i>Stefan?</i>

469
00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.840
<i>Yes, and so what, Rabbit's a toy.</i>

470
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.680
<i>A baby's toy that he takes everywhere.</i>

471
00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.600
<i>He's five.</i>

472
00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.840
<i>And by five,</i>
<i>he should've stopped playing with dolls.</i>

473
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.000
- <i>It's not a doll.</i>
- If he takes it to your parents,

474
00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.480
I'm going to have to withstand
another lecture from your dad

475
00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.600
- about permissive child-rearing.
- Oh, for God's sake.

476
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.120
I'm sorry, look,
I am going to do something about this.

477
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.440
No!

478
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.400
Who's doing this to me?

479
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.520
I know there's someone there.

480
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.240
Who's there?

481
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.720
Who are you?

482
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.080
Just give me a sign.

483
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.000
Come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

484
00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.440
Will you give me a sign?

485
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.280
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign.

486
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.600
Fucking hell.

487
00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.440
Who... What the fuck is Netflix?

488
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.280
Seriously, what does that mean?

489
00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.880
I don't know what that means.

490
00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.760
You're not making any sense.
Can you make sense?

491
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.440
I don't understand. I-I don't understand.

492
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.240
Who are you talking to?

493
00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.880
It'll sound crazy.

494
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.240
Well, tell me anyway.

495
00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.600
I'm being controlled by someone
from the future.

496
00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:09.880
What?

497
00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.000
I'm being controlled
by someone from the future.

498
00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.600
- Shall I ring Dr. Haynes?
- Yes, please.

499
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.160
So, you're being controlled
by someone on Netflix.

500
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.800
- What is Netflix? Is it a planet?
- I don't know, it...

501
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.600
It's some sort
of future entertainment thing.

502
00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.280
- Like a computer game?
- I don't know.

503
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.680
It's from the 21st Century, they said.

504
00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.400
OK, well,
let's try to pick it apart logically,

505
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.160
to see if we can define
if this is reality or delusion.

506
00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.720
- It's not a delusion.
- OK, let's go through it.

507
00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.200
OK.

508
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:08.120
So all of this is happening
to entertain someone.

509
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.560
- Someone who's controlling you.
- Uh-huh.

510
00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.240
So why aren't you
in a more entertaining scenario?

511
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.440
- What do you mean?
- Well, look at you.

512
00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.440
You're in a small ordinary room,
in an ordinary part of the world,

513
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.480
talking to an ordinary woman.

514
00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.400
If this was entertainment,
surely you'd make it more interesting.

515
00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.320
Inject a little action, isn't that right?

516
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.600
I mean, wouldn't you want
a little more action

517
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.440
if you were watching this now on telly?

518
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.480
Come at me. Come on, mummy's boy.
What are you waiting for?

519
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.200
Come on. I dare you.

520
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.240
Cut!

521
00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.080
Sorry, are you OK?

522
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.640
Two sugars.

523
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.160
I-I was, er...

524
00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.640
Window.

525
00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.560
Window.

526
00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.920
I was trying to open the window.
To jump out.

527
00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.640
You don't jump out.

528
00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.120
You can't jump out. It doesn't open, look.

529
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.400
You're not scripted to jump out,
see, Mike?

530
00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.920
It's the fight scene now.

531
00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.920
Mike?

532
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.440
Mike?

533
00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.800
Er... Stefan.

534
00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.160
Do you want to sit down for a moment?

535
00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.120
Can we get the medic down here please?

536
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.200
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

537
00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.520
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

538
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.960
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

539
00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.280
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

540
00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.800
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

541
00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.000
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

542
00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.680
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

543
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.560
<i>I'm concerned about...</i>

544
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.120
- Motown for computer games.
- Colin Ritman?

545
00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.200
- We've met before.
- What's your answer?

546
00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.600
Bit of madness is what you need.

547
00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.920
Stefan, will you talk to me?

548
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.560
Dad, just fuck off!

549
00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.680
Get your coat.

550
00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.920
This is Dr. Haynes' place.

551
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.640
You need to speak to her.

552
00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.080
You're under pressure.

553
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.560
You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

554
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.600
Stefan, come back.

555
00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.640
Stefan!

556
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.440
Colin.

557
00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.360
Hi.

558
00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.200
How's Bandersnatch going?

559
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.240
Not good.

560
00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.880
Not good. I'm just... lost.

561
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.040
- You're in the hole.
- In the what?

562
00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:46.640
- In a fight with your own head.
- Yes. That's exactly it.

563
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.800
- You got anywhere to be later?
- Er, well, no.

564
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.440
Come with me.

565
00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.120
Stefan, this is Kitty.

566
00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.160
And this is Pearl.

567
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.280
Daddy's little legacy.

568
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.840
Stefan's in the hole, Kit.

569
00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.200
Poor thing.

570
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.320
Are you going to get him out?

571
00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.360
Mm-hm.

572
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.920
Grab a pew.

573
00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:34.760
Here.

574
00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.200
- Oh. I haven't ever really...
- Come on.

575
00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.880
You'll get the hang of that.

576
00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.320
One for you...

577
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.960
One for me.

578
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:23.200
- What is it?
- It lets you see the bigger picture.

579
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.720
- I-I don't know.
- It'll help you understand.

580
00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.480
Do you want it?

581
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
It's your choice.

582
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.400
Totally up to you. Don't feel pressured.

583
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.360
Yes.

584
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.440
Do this.

585
00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.680
Now what?

586
00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.440
Now we just wait a bit.

587
00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.360
People think there's one reality

588
00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.720
but there's loads of them,
all snaking off, like roots.

589
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.440
And what we do on one path
affects what happens on the other paths.

590
00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.320
Time is a construct.

591
00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.200
People think you can't go back
and change things,

592
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.920
but you can, that's what flashbacks are,

593
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.840
they're invitations to go back
and make different choices.

594
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.960
When you make a decision,
you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

595
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.800
It's the spirit out there
that's connected to our world

596
00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.600
that decides what we do

597
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.200
and we just have to go along for the ride.

598
00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.240
Mirrors let you move through time.

599
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.960
The government monitors people,

600
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.560
they pay people to pretend
to be your relatives

601
00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.760
and they put drugs in your food
and they film you.

602
00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.040
There's messages in every game.

603
00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:59.760
Like Pac-Man.
Do you know what PAC stands for?

604
00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.000
P-A-C: "Program and Control."

605
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.920
He's Program and Control Man,
the whole thing's a metaphor,

606
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.040
he thinks he's got free will
but really he's trapped in a maze,

607
00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.200
in a system, all he can do is consume,

608
00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.600
he's pursued by demons
that are probably just in his own head,

609
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.680
and even if he does manage to escape
by slipping out one side of the maze,

610
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.120
what happens?
He comes right back in the other side.

611
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.000
People think it's a happy game,

612
00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.200
it's not a happy game,
it's a fucking nightmare world

613
00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.520
and the worst thing is
it's real and we live in it.

614
00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:28.680
It is all code.

615
00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:31.560
If you listen closely,
you can hear the numbers.

616
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:37.920
There's a cosmic flowchart that dictates
where you can and where you can't go.

617
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.160
I've given you the knowledge.
I've set you free.

618
00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.560
Do you understand?

619
00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.720
Maybe.

620
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.960
Yes. Sort of.

621
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.040
I'll show you what I mean. Come with me.

622
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.440
We're on one path.

623
00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.680
Right now, me and you.

624
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.160
And how one path ends is immaterial.

625
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:18.080
It's how our decisions along that path
affect the whole that matters.

626
00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.000
Do you believe me?

627
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.520
I don't know.

628
00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.280
I'll prove it.

629
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.520
One of us is going over.

630
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.840
Over there.

631
00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.320
You'd die. You'd die.

632
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.200
It wouldn't matter
because there are other timelines, Stefan.

633
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.200
How many times
have you watched Pac-Man die?

634
00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.000
Doesn't bother him.

635
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.920
He just tries again.

636
00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:54.520
One of us is jumping,
so who's it going to be?

637
00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.720
It's a nice breeze up here.

638
00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:09.080
So, come on, which one of us is jumping?

639
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.080
I'll do it.

640
00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.840
I like your style.

641
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.800
Oh! Oh!

642
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.320
<i>So, Robin, Bandersnatch, any good?</i>

643
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.200
<i>This is hard to say,</i>
<i>because as you may know,</i>

644
00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.040
<i>the original author of this game</i>
<i>was killed in a tragic accident.</i>

645
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.960
- <i>Indeed.</i>
<i>- But it's just not a good game.</i>

646
00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.240
<i>It seems someone else finished it off</i>
<i>quickly but it's just abrupt and jarring.</i>

647
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:23.320
<i>And unnecessary, and horrible,</i>
<i>and violent, unsettling, and weird,</i>

648
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:27.720
<i>and awful, and scary, and dark,</i>
<i>and bleak and creepy...</i>

649
00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.560
<i>The healthiest thing to do</i>
<i>is to talk about any concerns you may have</i>

650
00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.040
<i>instead of bottling them up inside.</i>

651
00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.440
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

652
00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.840
<i>The healthiest thing to do</i>
<i>is to talk about any concerns you may have</i>

653
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.360
<i>instead of bottling them up inside.</i>

654
00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.720
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

655
00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:54.120
<i>The healthiest thing to do</i>
<i>is to talk about any concerns you may have</i>

656
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.600
<i>instead of bottling them up inside.</i>

657
00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.000
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

658
00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.360
How many times
have you watched Pac-Man die?

659
00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.160
Doesn't bother him.

660
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.080
He just tries again.

661
00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:11.600
One of us is jumping,
so who's it going to be?

662
00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.920
It's a nice breeze up here.

663
00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:26.240
So, come on, which one of us is jumping?

664
00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.320
You do it.

665
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.600
Fair enough.

666
00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.040
See you around.

667
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:53.880
Where's Colin?

668
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.840
We're here.

669
00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.720
- Colin jumped and I didn't stop him.
- Stefan...

670
00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.320
maybe you're not well.

671
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.880
Go and speak to Dr. Haynes.

672
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.160
Please.

673
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:28.800
Alright.

674
00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:31.760
What sort of things?

675
00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.960
What I have for breakfast.
What music I listen to.

676
00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.480
Whether I bite my fucking nails.

677
00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:38.200
- You feel you're not...
- Making these decisions, no,

678
00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.280
and we've talked about this before.
I'm sure we have.

679
00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.160
And you tell me I feel guilty about my mum
and you up my dose.

680
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.520
And, yes, I am taking my medication, OK?

681
00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.280
So just write me the fucking prescription.

682
00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.760
We can't dupe them fast enough.
Everybody wants a bit of Colin Ritman.

683
00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.800
- Where is Colin?
- He's gone AWOL.

684
00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.960
Probably fucked off to Amsterdam
for a spot of gardening,

685
00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.720
if you know what I mean.
He'll be back, he always is.

686
00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.880
Mate. This is due today.

687
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.040
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path.

688
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.400
Don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

689
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.320
I know.

690
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:26.520
Er... Colin wanted me to give you this.
To inspire you.

691
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.640
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate.</i>

692
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:34.720
<i>If you follow that line of thinking</i>
<i>to its logical conclusion,</i>

693
00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.360
<i>then you're absolved of any guilt</i>
<i>from your actions.</i>

694
00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.560
<i>But they're not even your actions.</i>

695
00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.520
<i>It's out of your control.</i>

696
00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.720
<i>Your fate has been dictated.</i>

697
00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.840
<i>So, why not commit murder?</i>

698
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.760
<i>You're not in control.</i>

699
01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.840
Who's doing this to me?

700
01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.800
I know there's someone there.

701
01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.920
Who's there? Who are you?

702
01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.280
Just give me a sign.

703
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.280
Oh, come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

704
01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.720
Will you give me a sign?

705
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.600
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

706
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.800
Stefan?

707
01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.240
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

708
01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.920
Stefan, you're worrying me.

709
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.880
- I'm not in control. I'm not in control.
- What are you talking about? Stefan?

710
01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.440
- I'm being controlled.
- Stefan! Stefan? Stop it. OK?

711
01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.720
Look, you need to calm down.
Just take a breath, please and calm down.

712
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.680
In through your nose. Breathe.
Breathe in through the nose and out.

713
01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.080
Breathe in, Stefan. And out.

714
01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.040
Calm, Stefan.

715
01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.640
Get away from me! Please, Dad.

716
01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.480
Dad, just stay away from me.
I'm not in control.

717
01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.720
- Stefan, please.
- Dad, please get away from me.

718
01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.000
I'm not in control.
Please, I'm not in control.

719
01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.360
- Stefan.
- I'm not in control.

720
01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.000
What do I do?

721
01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.960
What do I do?

722
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:29.840
OK.

723
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.520
- Hello?
- The man himself, the whiz kid.

724
01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.440
How's it going?

725
01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.560
- How's it going?
- <i>Listen.</i>

726
01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.120
Colin's still off exploring
other dimensions.

727
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.760
He can't bail me out so I need the code.
First thing Monday you said.

728
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.200
The ads are out,
I've booked the dupe plants.

729
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.600
There's some serious cash down
the swanny if you don't deliver.

730
01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.480
I need it by the end of today.
That possible?

731
01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.400
<i>Stefan?</i>

732
01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.120
<i>Hello? Spit it out.</i>

733
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.720
Before I evolve.

734
01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.320
Will it be ready by the end of the day?

735
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.360
- Of course.
<i>- Good.</i>

736
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.280
By the end of today, no later. Tatty bye.

737
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.720
Where's Colin? Where is he?

738
01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.320
- Where... where is he?
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Can I help?

739
01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.720
- It's Colin's girlfriend.
- Kitty. We've met before.

740
01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.880
When you had blue hair.
Satpal, I'll deal with this.

741
01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.080
- Where's Colin?
- I thought you'd tell me.

742
01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.520
He's gone, he's just gone.

743
01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.920
Tell me about it
but he's done this before.

744
01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:42.800
Not like this. When did you see him last?

745
01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.880
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

746
01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.440
Who's Stefan?

747
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.240
Let's leave Stefan out of this,
he's working.

748
01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.200
Who is Stefan?

749
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.520
Are you Stefan?

750
01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.040
Yes. We... we've met before.

751
01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.480
No, we haven't.

752
01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.160
Do you know where Colin is?

753
01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.280
Er...

754
01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.040
I was in the office and Satpal
said you'd seen him last.

755
01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.360
If you know where he is, please tell me.

756
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.200
No, I'm sorry. I don't... I don't know.

757
01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.680
I don't know anything about anything.

758
01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.080
Right.

759
01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.960
Well, if you hear from Colin,
tell him to ring Kitty.

760
01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:20.920
OK. I've got to go.

761
01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.000
<i>And that's why futurologists believe</i>

762
01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.000
<i>you'll be able to play</i>
<i>the games of the future anywhere.</i>

763
01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:35.760
<i>On a bus, or the tube,</i>
<i>in the palm of your hand.</i>

764
01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.880
<i>- Crispin?</i>
<i>- Thanks, Leslie.</i>

765
01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.600
<i>Now yesterday, following weeks</i>
<i>of controversy and speculation,</i>

766
01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:48.000
<i>games company Tuckersoft</i>
<i>announced it's going into liquidation.</i>

767
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.040
<i>So what went wrong?</i>

768
01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.880
<i>Just six months ago,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

769
01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.320
<i>with a string of hits topping the charts</i>

770
01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.360
<i>and mounting anticipation for their</i>
<i>big Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

771
01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.040
<i>But Bandersnatch never appeared,</i>

772
01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.680
<i>following the arrest and subsequent</i>
<i>murder charge against its creator,</i>

773
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.920
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

774
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.280
<i>who stands accused</i>
<i>of murdering his father,</i>

775
01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.400
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

776
01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.240
<i>This has raised questions about</i>
<i>the judgement of Tuckersoft boss,</i>

777
01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.880
<i>Mohan Thakur.</i>

778
01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.200
<i>It was his idea to do it alone.</i>
<i>His decision.</i>

779
01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.080
<i>I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.</i>

780
01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.960
<i>I mean, I know his dad's dead,</i>
<i>rest his soul, but I'm a victim too.</i>

781
01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.760
<i>Let's try to not forget that.</i>

782
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.320
<i>But there's another Tuckersoft</i>
<i>protégé at the centre of a mystery.</i>

783
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.400
<i>Famed programmer Colin Ritman</i>
<i>is still missing,</i>

784
01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.320
<i>having vanished without trace</i>
<i>shortly before the killings.</i>

785
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.200
<i>At the trial,</i>
<i>Butler denied any involvement</i>

786
01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.400
<i>in Ritman's sudden disappearance,</i>

787
01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:52.880
<i>claiming he had seen Ritman</i>
<i>committing suicide in a vision.</i>

788
01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.200
<i>Today,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft closed its doors for good.</i>

789
01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.280
<i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

790
01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.360
<i>What do I do?</i>

791
01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.880
<i>What do I do?</i>

792
01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.360
<i>How many times have you</i>
<i>watched Pac-Man die?</i>

793
01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:42.120
<i>Doesn't bother him. He just tries again.</i>

794
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.560
Colin Ritman.

795
01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.400
- We've met before.
- No.

796
01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:52.480
We met before. I told you
I'd see you around. And I was right.

797
01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.280
We're going to be late.
Are you coming or not?

798
01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.760
- No!
<i>- The 8:45 derailed...</i>

799
01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.320
Fuck off! I'm not in control.

800
01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.360
- We're in it together.
- The deadline is today.

801
01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.640
- <i>I just need the weekend.</i>
<i>- Bit of inspiration maybe.</i>

802
01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.640
<i>You're just a puppet.</i>

803
01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.280
<i>So, why not commit murder?</i>

804
01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.320
Just give me a fucking sign!

805
01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.280
Stefan?

806
01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.400
What do I do?

807
01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.400
Oh, God, really?

808
01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.480
Dr. Haynes' office.

809
01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.120
- Is Dr. Haynes there?
- <i>No. She's with a client right now.</i>

810
01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.680
<i>Would you like to make an appointment?</i>
<i>I could fit you in...</i>

811
01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.440
<i>first thing tomorrow.</i>

812
01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.120
Yes.

813
01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.040
<i>- And your name is?</i>
- Stefan Butler.

814
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.600
He's fucking engaged.

815
01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.720
He's probably taken the phone
off the hook.

816
01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.400
- That's what I do.
- That's what you do, is it?

817
01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.880
I'll remember that.

818
01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.920
Look, just let him be.

819
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:31.040
- He's probably in the zone.
- OK. I'll give him another 24 hours.

820
01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.320
<i>And how is your father?</i>

821
01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.560
He's visiting his sister.
She's in the South of France, so...

822
01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.680
So you've been left to your own devices.

823
01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.600
Mm-hm.

824
01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.640
It's been good actually.

825
01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.920
Not having him.

826
01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.240
<i>It's meant I could work</i>
<i>with a real sense of purpose.</i>

827
01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.080
<i>I've actually had a bit of breakthrough</i>
<i>with the game.</i>

828
01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.440
<i>I think I'd got bogged down before</i>
<i>but now I can see.</i>

829
01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.120
<i>So you finally finished it?</i>

830
01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.160
<i>Finished, delivered, everything.</i>

831
01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.840
<i>I'd been trying to give the player</i>
<i>too much choice.</i>

832
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.800
<i>So I just went back</i>
<i>and stripped loads out.</i>

833
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.000
<i>And now they've got the illusion</i>
<i>of free will, but really...</i>

834
01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.080
I decide the ending.

835
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.560
And is it a happy ending?

836
01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.080
I think so.

837
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.920
Then that's great.

838
01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.560
So Bandersnatch? Yes or no?

839
01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.880
Yes, yes, and yes.
It's got all the bases covered.

840
01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.120
The perfect game.

841
01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.560
Well, that is a first.
So your rating is...

842
01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.320
My rating is five stars out of five.
Magnificent.

843
01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.760
That was the game Bandersnatch
being reviewed on TV back in 1984.

844
01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.960
But shortly after its release,
a dark secret emerged.

845
01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.560
<i>Its author Stefan Butler was discovered</i>
<i>to have murdered his own father.</i>

846
01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.120
<i>The game was pulled from shelves</i>
<i>and all the copies were pulped.</i>

847
01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.600
<i>Now, in a move that's bound</i>
<i>to cause controversy,</i>

848
01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.600
<i>a new coder wants to reboot the game</i>
<i>for a new generation.</i>

849
01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.000
My dad was a coder himself
back in the day,

850
01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.320
and I found Stefan's game in an old crate,

851
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.600
<i>I ran it on an emulator, RetroArch.</i>
<i>And I found it really ground-breaking.</i>

852
01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.320
<i>I can see why people think</i>
<i>it's controversial</i>

853
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.000
<i>to be remaking it today,</i>

854
01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.520
<i>but the free will concept is fascinating.</i>

855
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:14.280
Today, interactive stories of this kind
are available on your TV, or laptop,

856
01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.560
your phone, so I'm developing this
for streaming TV platforms.

857
01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.560
<i>There's a rumour that platform is Netflix.</i>

858
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.960
I'm not allowed to talk about rumours.

859

<i>♪ Relax, don't do it</i>
<i>When you want to go to it ♪</i>

860

Oh, fuck!

861
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:34.160
Would you like to talk
about what happened with your mother?

862
01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.440
<i>I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.</i>

863
01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.400
- Are you coming or not?
- No!

864
01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.760
<i>The 8:45 train derailed...</i>

865
01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.600
- He should've stopped playing with dolls.
- It's not a doll.

866
01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.760
Sorry, look, I am going to do
something about this.

867
01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.440
Stefan?

868
01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:26.880
What are you doing in here?

869
01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.120
You went looking for him.

870
01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.040
Go on.

871
01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.520
Take him.

872
01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.120
You put him back where he belongs.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.160
You don't need him.

875
01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.520
We can look for Rabbit tomorrow.

876
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.240
Found him!

877
01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.440
Great!

878
01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.440
OK, well, we're going to miss the 8:30.

879
01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.960

I don't understand.
He was just sitting there.

891

We were talking.
He closed his eyes for a few moments.

- Fuck off!

- My head is all over the place.
- You're in the hole.

898
01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.760
The government monitors people,

899
01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.880
they pay people to pretend
to be your relatives

900
01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.200
and they put drugs in your food.

901
01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.840
Do you know what PAC stands for?
"Program and Control".

902
01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:01.360
It's a fucking nightmare world.
It's real and we live in it.

903
01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.840
Come on, Stefan. Come on.

904
01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.760
- You can find Rabbit later.
- No!

905
01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.080
Stefan, please come with me.

906
01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.760
No!

907
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.800
You weren't supposed to know.

908
01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:26.000
Dad, what is this?

909
01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:28.880
I'm sorry.

910
01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.360
Dad, who are you?

911
01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.120
Talk to me.

912
01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.320
Talk to me!

913
01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.560
Who's doing this to me?

914
01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.320
I know there's someone there.

915
01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.560
Who's there? Who are you?

916
01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.840
Just give me a sign.

917
01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.800
Oh, come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

918
01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.200
Will you give me a sign?

919
01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:16.160
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

920
01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.600
What's wrong?

921
01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.800
Stefan, what's wrong?

922
01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.000
I know you've been controlling me.

923
01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:00.040
You and Haynes.
I know about PACS, the P.A.C.S. thing.

924
01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:04.280
I know you've been drugging me,
I know you've been recording me

925
01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.560
and now you're putting messages
on my computer.

926
01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.640
Stefan, you're ill.

927
01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:12.600
We need to go and see Dr. Haynes
and see if she can help.

928
01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.560
I know what you've been doing to me.

929
01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.480
I know.

930
01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.640
<i>Remember, Stefan. Any time you need me.</i>

931
01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.600
You know the number.

932
01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.280
- You heard it here first.
- Get a pen.

933
01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.960
If you listen closely,
you can hear the numbers.

934
01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.960
- Too?
- Good to be true.

935
01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:46.520
<i>You sound like my dad.</i>

936
01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:47.800
Oh.

937
01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.440
<i>Five.</i>

938
01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.920
You were five years old.

939
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.520
- One for all, and all...
- For one.

940
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.920
<i>Remember, Stefan.</i>
<i>Any time you need me.</i>

941
01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.560
<i>You know the number.</i>

942
01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.520
Number? What's the number?

943
01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.240
<i>Two. Oh. Five.</i>

944
01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.360
Four, one.

945
01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:10.840
Remember.

946
01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:15.240
- <i>Two. Oh. Five.</i>
<i>- Four, one.</i>

947
01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:44.040
Dr. Haynes office.

948
01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.480
Is she there?

949
01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.720
Dr. Haynes?
No, she's at her sister's wedding.

950
01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.040
She's back tomorrow.
Can I take a message?

951
01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.880
Tell her that Stefan Butler called.

952
01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.040
Stefan Butler...

953
01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:01.440
And I know about Program and Control.

954
01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:04.920
- I'm sorry?
<i>- I know they've been monitoring me.</i>

955
01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.120
I know what they've been up to.
Her and Dad.

956
01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:12.200
The Program and Control Study.

957
01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.400
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

958
01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:17.320
They're monitoring me now, aren't they?

959
01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:23.840
Tell her I've killed Dad
and I'm gonna kill her next.

960
01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.920
- Is this...
- Fuck off.

961
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.280
So Bandersnatch? Yay or nay?

962
01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.320
Well, nothing in the game
is as fascinating

963
01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.640
as its grisly real-life backstory.

964
01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:18.520
As you know, Leslie, Stefan Butler,
the young man who wrote this,

965
01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.960
had a breakdown
and murdered his own father.

966
01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:21.960
<i>Yes, very sad.</i>

967
01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:24.400
<i>And it seems the code</i>
<i>was never quite finished</i>

968
01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.280
<i>but Tuckersoft just released</i>
<i>the game anyway.</i>

969
01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.320
<i>Which I know isn't a crime</i>
<i>on a par with murder</i>

970
01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.200
<i>but it's still pretty off nonetheless.</i>

971
01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:31.920
<i>Quite. So your verdict?</i>

972
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.840
<i>Two and a half stars out of five.</i>
<i>It's morbid curiosity value at best.</i>

973
01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:37.200
<i>Must try harder.</i>

974
01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.720
Oi!

975
01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:55.280

Go on.

978
01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.640

Ah. You... are... Steven.

991
01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.800
- Stefan.
- Stefan, sorry, mate.

992
01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.000
That's alright, I get it all the time.

993
01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.240
Sorry about the chaos.
We just moved in Monday.

994
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.160
It's big.

995
01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.640
Well, expansion, that's my plan.

996
01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:40.280
Imagine, OK,
a whole team just for graphics,

997
01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:42.680
another for sound, for gameplay.

998
01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:47.000
We're going to be a hit factory.
Like Motown but for computer games.

999
01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.920
You heard it here first.

1000
01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.480
That's Colin's new one.

1001
01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.240
- Colin Ritman?
- That's him over there.

1002
01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.440
That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

1003
01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:03.600
Let's say hello.

1004
01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:07.680
- Sure he won't mind, he's working?
- He'll be fine. He'll be fine. Shh! Shh!

1005
01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:09.760
Wait, wait, wait.

1006
01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:15.080
What's this, Kajagoogoo?

1007
01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.400
You wish.

1008
01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.840
State of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini

1009
01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.680
and he still smokes roll-ups.

1010
01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:26.440
Yeah, well, pre-rolled have strychnine
in them, so the joke's on him.

1011
01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.120
Anyway, this is Stefan, er...

1012
01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:31.560
Butler, Butler.

1013
01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.720
I'm Colin, yeah.

1014
01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:39.240
Yeah, I've played all of your games.
All of them.

1015
01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:42.640
Except the Commodore ones,
I don't have a Commodore.

1016
01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.960
- Great sound chip, the Commodore.
- Mm-hm.

1017
01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:47.880
Yeah.

1018
01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:50.800
This is my latest.

1019
01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.720
It's called Nohzdyve.

1020
01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:06.720
- The sprites are so smooth.
- That took some doing.

1021
01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:11.040
Oh, bollocks.

1022
01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.800
- What's that?
- It's a buffer error.

1023
01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.520
The eyeballs have overrun
the video memory, and...

1024
01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:19.600
Oh, yeah, yeah, video memory, yeah.
I was gonna say that.

1025
01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.640
Anyway, listen,
let's get down to business.

1026
01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:23.880
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

1027
01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.680
Bloody hell.

1028
01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:30.440
So it's like 3D Monster Maze?

1029
01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:32.640
Only when you're moving
from choice to choice.

1030
01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:36.040
- It's actually an adventure game.
- Like<i> The Hobbit.</i>

1031
01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:39.040
Yes, but without any typing.

1032
01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:42.720
Without any typing?
So no "get lamp" or whatever?

1033
01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.200
That's right.

1034
01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:55.000
Choices come up on the screen
and you pick one against the clock.

1035
01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:59.160
OK, he's Pax, he's the demon.
He's in the book.

1036
01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.040
So we've actually arrived
at a choice point,

1037
01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.960
and then you can choose with the joystick.

1038
01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.000
You've got ten seconds.

1039
01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.200
Worship him.

1040
01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:09.920
No, don't do that, he's the
Thief of Destiny, in the book, I mean.

1041
01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.520
Got a copy of this at home.
Never got around to reading it.

1042
01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.440
You should.
Jerome F. Davies was a genius.

1043
01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.160
Didn't he go bonkers
and cut his wife's head off?

1044
01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:21.240
- Yeah, but I mean, apart from that...
- Excuse me.

1045
01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:26.600
What's happened?

1046
01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:29.040
Well, I haven't programmed
that pathway yet.

1047
01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:30.160
Lot of paths then?

1048
01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.760
Well, yeah,
if it's going to be like the book.

1049
01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:37.200
So, come on.
How do you want to go about this?

1050
01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:42.160
- You're... you're interested?
- That's what I'm saying.

1051
01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.880
OK, it's July now,
so if we want to hit Christmas,

1052
01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.960
then we'll need the tapes in Smiths
by November.

1053
01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:51.400
OK. So here's my proposal.
Come and write it here.

1054
01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:53.720
- Here?
- Yeah!

1055
01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.480
We'll give you a couple of desks,
set up a small team, just for you.

1056
01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.640
And of course Col's on hand.

1057
01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.160
What do you reckon?

1058
01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.920
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1059
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.920
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1060
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.200
So, come on. What's your answer?

1061
01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.400
<i>♪ Relax, don't... ♪</i>

1062
01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:24.400
Breakfast?

1063
01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.880
- Your Bander-what?
- Bandersnatch.

1064
01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.520
- It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.
- That bloody hound from next door!

1065
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.520
Be the death of us.

1066
01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.680
<i>♪ I want to breathe in the open wind ♪</i>

1067
01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.080
<i>♪ I want to kiss like... ♪</i>

1068
01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:42.080
We're going to be a hit factory.

1069
01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:45.160
Colin Ritman? That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

1070
01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:48.240
State of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini

1071
01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.240
and he still smokes roll-ups.

1072
01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:58.400
- We've met before.
- No.

1073
01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:02.840
This is what I'm working on.

1074
01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:07.640
- Nohzdyve.
- Yeah. That's right.

1075
01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.120
Oh, bollocks.

1076
01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.880
- What's that?
- Buffer error.

1077
01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:21.760
Those eyeball sprites overshot
the video memory.

1078
01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:24.440
How did you know that?

1079
01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:28.280
- Just did.
- Bloody hell, he's good, right?

1080
01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:33.200
Anyway, let's get down to business.
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

1081
01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.720
You choose with the joystick.
See. You've got ten seconds.

1082
01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.120
Don't worship him,
he's the Thief of Destiny.

1083
01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:43.680
- You've read<i> Bandersnatch?</i>
- Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

1084
01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:46.280
Was he that bloke who went cuckoo
and cut his wife's head off?

1085
01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.520
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

1086
01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:51.280
Which ending did you get?
When you read it.

1087
01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.720
- All of them.
- Excuse me.

1088
01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.920
- What's happened?
- I haven't programmed that path yet.

1089
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.280
Right. So, a lot of paths then?

1090
01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:05.000
Well, yes,
if it's going to be like the book.

1091
01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.680
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

1092
01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.560
It was ahead of its time.
In as much as time exists.

1093
01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:16.080
OK. So here's my proposal.
Come and write it here.

1094
01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.000
Here?

1095
01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:20.640
We'll give you a couple of desks,
set up a small team, just for you.

1096
01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:21.840
And of course Col's on hand.

1097
01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.720
What do you reckon?

1098
01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.400
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1099
01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.560
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1100
01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:32.320
So, come on. What's your answer?

1101
01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:36.080
No.

1102
01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:48.760
I mean, yes, I want to do your game.
I just... I just think I need to...

1103
01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.880
I need to write it how I know.

1104
01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.480
You know, just me. At home.

1105
01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.160
At home. On your own?

1106
01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.960
Yeah, it's just that it's all in my head,

1107
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:09.040
and I think if I let other people in,
it'll just get, I don't know, stressy?

1108
01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:10.800
"Stressy"?

1109
01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:17.440
But I know that I can do it
proper justice. The book.

1110
01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:21.640
You know, divergent story paths.
Parallel realities.

1111
01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:24.400
- It's still a game though, yeah?
- I get it.

1112
01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.280
The lad's a craftsman.

1113
01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:29.280
He's a lone woodsman. I'm the same.

1114
01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.280
- Yeah, but...
- It's like I say,

1115
01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:33.920
teams are fine
for things like action titles,

1116
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.800
but when it's a concept piece,

1117
01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:40.600
bit of madness is what you need
and that works best when it's one mind.

1118
01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:43.480
Alright, Timothy Leary, we'll debate
<i>The Doors of Perception</i> later...

1119
01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:44.960
That was Huxley, not Leary.

1120
01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:46.400
If you're going to write this on your tod,

1121
01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.400
the important thing is
putting it out for Christmas,

1122
01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.920
so I'll need finished code
by 12th September.

1123
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
- OK, sure.
- But no later.

1124
01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.720
What do you listen to?

1125
01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.480
To get in to the flow.

1126
01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:09.520
Oh, music?

1127
01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:15.400
Er, compilations mainly.

1128
01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:17.760
Get a pen.

1129
01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:23.880
I'm defrosting mince.

1130
01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.400
It's like alien technology this thing.

1131
01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:35.840
Oh. How... how did it go?

1132
01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.880
Good. Yeah, really good.

1133
01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.080
They're taking it.

1134
01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:44.680
Oh, well, that's great, isn't it?

1135
01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.000
- Well done, mate.
- You've got mince juice on your hands.

1136
01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:51.680
Yes.

1137
01:40:54.920 --> 01:41:00.040
So, how does it work then?
Do you go into their office, or...?

1138
01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.480
No, I write it here.

1139
01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:05.080
- On your own?
- Yes.

1140
01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:10.680
And...

1141
01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:14.640
Is that the best way
to work on something like this?

1142
01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:15.880
Why wouldn't it be?

1143
01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.880
<i>Well, the graphics</i>
<i>are certainly impressive, Robin,</i>

1144
01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:22.000
<i>but the big question is,</i>
<i>what's it like to play?</i>

1145
01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.160
<i>Well, the gameplay is just as impressive,</i>
<i>I must say.</i>

1146
01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.680
<i>This is a Colin Ritman game,</i>
<i>so we'd expect little else,</i>

1147
01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.560
<i>but even by his standards</i>
<i>this is really most impressive.</i>

1148
01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:34.400
<i>It's challenging,</i>
<i>there's quite a big learning curve,</i>

1149
01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.600
<i>so you die a lot and have to try again</i>
<i>but I really didn't mind that much.</i>

1150
01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:41.680
<i>So it sounds great</i>
<i>but what's your verdict, Robin?</i>

1151
01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:44.400
<i>Four stars out of five.</i>
<i>Colin Ritman does it again.</i>

1152
01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:47.280
- <i>So not quite perfect.</i>
<i>- Well, nothing's perfect.</i>

1153
01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.480
So there I am, there's Colin Ritman...

1154
01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:57.400
"The actual Colin Ritman,"
I believe you called him.

1155
01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.520
Yeah, exactly, and Mr. Thakur's
offering me the chance to work there

1156
01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:06.760
in their own office alongside Colin.

1157
01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:09.400
And I just...

1158
01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:14.600
- I don't know. It was too...
- Too?

1159
01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.320
Good to be true.

1160
01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.120
- I said no.
- You said "no"?

1161
01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.240
Well, not to the whole thing,

1162
01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:25.880
just to working there
and being under their control.

1163
01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.800
I don't know where it came from,

1164
01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.920
I just said "no"
and then had to justify it

1165
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.120
by saying that I prefer to work alone.

1166
01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:36.760
But I just don't know
where the urge to say it came from.

1167
01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:41.400
It sounds like you're growing
in confidence. I think it's a good sign.

1168
01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:45.360
Well, they're still letting me
do the game, so...

1169
01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:49.680
Well done, Stefan. That's great.

1170
01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:53.080
You sound like my dad.

1171
01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.000
Oh.

1172
01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.320
Sorry.

1173
01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.800
He gets on my nerves sometimes.

1174
01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.760
Like this... I'm fine now,

1175
01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:14.560
I don't see why I need
to keep coming to these sessions.

1176
01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:20.720
It just feels like being,
I don't know, monitored.

1177
01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.760
Perhaps you're feeling intruded upon
because of the anniversary looming.

1178
01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.560
It's a difficult time of year for you.
We can't underestimate that.

1179
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.800
Would you like to talk
about what happened with your mother?

1180
01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:45.880
It can be helpful to revisit things.
Even if you feel you've done this before.

1181
01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:50.760
You might discover something new.

1182
01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:22.720
<i>The government put drugs</i>
<i>in your food and they film you.</i>

1183
01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:22.040
We can't dupe them fast enough.
Everybody wants a bit of Colin Ritman.

1184
01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:26.200
- Where is Colin?
- God knows. He's gone AWOL.

1185
01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:29.160
He hasn't come in, answered his phone.
Par for the course from him.

1186
01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:31.440
Probably fucked off to Amsterdam
for a spot of gardening.

1187
01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:34.040
He'll be back, he always is.
Anyway, come on.

1188
01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:47.760
Looking good.
Good thing I doubled on the advertising.

1189
01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:55.960
That's not...

1190
01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.760
Stefan, mate. This is due today.
You said it was stable.

1191
01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:00.840
- It was, I just...
- Just what?

1192
01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:02.440
I added in a new path,

1193
01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:05.200
the government conspiracy branch,
I thought I'd tied up all the loose ends.

1194
01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:06.600
If it's something you've added,
let's just take it out.

1195
01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:08.920
- No, it's important.
- Stefan, mate.

1196
01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:11.040
The deadline is today.

1197
01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:14.640
I just need the weekend.
I know I can squeeze this path in.

1198
01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:17.360
- It's complicated enough.
- Just the weekend. Please.

1199
01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:22.720
- First thing Monday.
- First thing.

1200
01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:26.400
OK. Shit, I've got to run,
meeting the John Menzies guys.

1201
01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.840
Just don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

1202
01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:31.920
I know.

1203
01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:40.760
Er... Colin wanted me to give you this.

1204
01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:43.240
What is it?

1205
01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:45.840
He said he taped it off the telly,
to inspire you.

1206
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.800
- Do you know where Colin is?
- No. Sorry.

1207
01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:20.320
You having a film night?

1208
01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:34.200
<i>- They're great!</i>
<i>- Kellogg's Frosties.</i>

1209
01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:40.760
<i>Towards the end of his life,</i>

1210
01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:45.520
<i>Davies was apparently self-administering</i>
<i>hallucinogens on a daily basis.</i>

1211
01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.480
<i>This, coupled with his attempts</i>

1212
01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:50.680
<i>to complete the complex multiple</i>
<i>narratives of</i> Bandersnatch

1213
01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:52.720
<i>was to prove the final straw.</i>

1214
01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.520
<i>He became obsessed</i>
<i>with bizarre symbols</i>

1215
01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.320
<i>and the limitations</i>
<i>of his own free will.</i>

1216
01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:02.360
<i>In his notes,</i>
<i>Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph</i>

1217
01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:07.640
<i>which to him represented multiple fates,</i>
<i>potential realities splitting in two.</i>

1218
01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:12.440
<i>It was the start</i>
<i>of his complete mental collapse.</i>

1219
01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:16.040
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate</i>

1220
01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.440
<i>because his wife was spiking him</i>
<i>with psychoactive drugs</i>

1221
01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.160
<i>at the behest of a demon called Pax,</i>
<i>a sort of lion figure,</i>

1222
01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.000
<i>he claimed he'd seen in a vision,</i>

1223
01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.640
<i>and who ended up</i>
<i>being incorporated into the book.</i>

1224
01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:34.040
<i>It was this that led him to kill her.</i>

1225
01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:39.360
<i>He decapitated her and daubed the</i>
<i>glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.</i>

1226
01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:43.280
<i>After his arrest, he told police</i>

1227
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:47.040
<i>we exist within</i>
<i>multiple parallel realities at once.</i>

1228
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.400
<i>One reality for each possible course</i>
<i>of action we might take in life.</i>

1229
01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:55.520
<i>Whatever we choose to do</i>
<i>in this existence,</i>

1230
01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.880
<i>there’s another one out there</i>
<i>in which we’re doing quite the opposite,</i>

1231
01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.680
<i>which renders free will meaningless.</i>
<i>Nothing but an illusion.</i>

1232
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.040
<i>Mirrors let you move through time.</i>

1233
01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.680
Yes, and so what, Rabbit is a toy.

1234
01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:33.080
<i>A baby's toy that he takes everywhere.</i>

1235
01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:34.000
<i>He's five.</i>

1236
01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:36.240
<i>By five he should've stopped</i>
<i>playing with dolls.</i>

1237
01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.360
- <i>It's not a doll.</i>
- If he takes it to your parents,

1238
01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:40.640
I'm going to have to withstand
another lecture from your dad

1239
01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:42.440
- about permissive child-rearing.
- Oh, for God's sake.

1240
01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:45.680
No, I'm sorry, look,
I am going to do something about this.

1241
01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:14.920
Ah!

1242
01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:22.280
How's that for entertainment,
you psychiatric fuck? Huh?

1243
01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:24.520
Fucked your day up good and proper,
didn't we?

1244
01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:27.320
Huh?
Me and my friend from the future!

1245
01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:01.600
Yes.

1246
01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:04.240
Perfect. Perfect.

1247
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:07.360
OK, so the first thing we need to do
is streamline the project a little.

1248
01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:09.800
We can't fit a breeze block
of a book into 48K.

1249
01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:15.840
Sorry, mate. Wrong path.

1250
01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:26.280
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1251
01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.760
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1252
01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:30.000
What do you reckon?

1253
01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:33.840
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1254
01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:36.320
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1255
01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:37.400
What do you reckon?

1256
01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.400
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1257
01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:43.880
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1258
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:44.960
What do you reckon?

1259
01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:49.000
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1260
01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:51.200
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1261
01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.600
So, come on.
How do you want to go about this?

1262
01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:58.560
- You're... you're interested?
- That's what I'm saying.

1263
01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:01.280
OK, it's July now,
so if we wanna hit Christmas,

1264
01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:03.360
then we'll need the tapes in Smiths
by November.

1265
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:07.800
OK. So here's my proposal.
Come and write it here.

1266
01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.120
- Here?
- Yeah!

1267
01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:13.880
We'll give you a couple of desks,
set up a small team, just for you.

1268
01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:15.880
And of course Col's on hand.

1269
01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:17.560
What do you reckon?

1270
01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:21.320
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1271
01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:23.720
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1272
01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:26.600
So, come on. What's your answer?

1273
01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:31.840
- No.
- A bit of madness is what you need.

1274
01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:37.160
Would you like to talk about your mother?

1275
01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:42.760
<i>Is everything alright?</i>

1276
01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:50.600
<i>Stefan, I'm worried about you.</i>
<i>You've been stuck in your room for weeks.</i>

1277
01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:57.880
Stefan?

1278
01:54:58.880 --> 01:54:59.960
Will you talk to me?

1279
01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.720
Look, I can't help you if you just
sit there and don't speak!

1280
01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:12.200
<i>♪ Relax, don't... ♪</i>

1281
01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:18.200
Breakfast?

1282
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.680
- Your Bander-what?
- Bandersnatch.

1283
01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:23.280
- It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.
- That bloody hound from next door!

1284
01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:24.400
Be the death of us.

1285
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.480
<i>♪ I want to breathe in the open wind ♪</i>

1286
01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:33.880
<i>♪ I want to kiss like... ♪</i>

1287
01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.880
We're going to be a hit factory.

1288
01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:38.920
Colin Ritman? That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

1289
01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.080
State of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini

1290
01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:45.440
and he still smokes roll-ups.

1291
01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:51.800
We've met before.

1292
01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:54.800
- No.
- We met before.

1293
01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:58.240
I told you I'd see you around.
And I was right.

1294
01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:02.760
- This is what I'm working on.
- Nohzdyve.

1295
01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:09.560
- Oh, bollocks.
- What's that?

1296
01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:13.080
Buffer error. The eyeball sprites
overshot the video memory.

1297
01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:14.760
Yep.

1298
01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.840
Don't worship him,
he's the Thief of Destiny.

1299
01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:21.440
- You've read<i> Bandersnatch?</i>
- Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

1300
01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:24.000
Was he that bloke who went cuckoo
and cut his wife's head off?

1301
01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:26.240
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

1302
01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:27.840
Excuse me.

1303
01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:34.280
- What's happened?
- I haven't programmed that path yet.

1304
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:36.480
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

1305
01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:40.640
It was ahead of its time.
In as much as time exists.

1306
01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:45.880
OK. So here's my proposal.
Come and write it here.

1307
01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:48.840
- Here?
- We'll give you a couple of desks,

1308
01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:51.680
set up a small team, just for you.
And of course Col's on hand.

1309
01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:53.480
What do you reckon?

1310
01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:57.200
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1311
01:56:57.280 --> 01:56:59.520
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1312
01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:02.400
So, come on. What's your answer?

1313
01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:05.840
- No.
- Bit of madness is what you need.

1314

Would you like to talk about your mother?

1315
01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:15.720
<i>Is everything alright?</i>

1316
01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:19.160
Look, I can't help if you just sit there
and don't speak!

1317
01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:20.880
Dad, just fuck off!

1318
01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:25.840
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

1319
01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:33.160
- This is Dr. Haynes' place.
- You need to speak to her.

1320
01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:37.760
You're under pressure.
You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

1321
01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:44.600
I think the healthiest thing to do
is to talk about any concerns you may have

1322
01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:46.920
instead of bottling them up inside.

1323
01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:54.240
We've talked about this before.
I'm sure we have.

1324
01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:56.160
So just write me the fucking prescription.

1325
01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.920
Stefan, mate. This is due today.

1326
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.240
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path in.

1327
01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:04.520
Don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

1328
01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:09.880
<i>We exist within</i>
<i>multiple parallel realities at once.</i>

1329
01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:14.160

01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:24.160
<i>which renders free will meaningless.</i>
<i>Nothing but an illusion.</i>

1333
01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:27.840
- This is Dr. Haynes' place.
- You need to speak to her.

1334
01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:30.120
My head is all over the place.
I'm not in control.

1335
01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:33.560
<i>Stefan, mate, the deadline is today.</i>

1336
01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:35.880
<i>You're not in control.</i>

1337
02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:04.920
No!

1338
02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:09.920
Who's doing this to me?

1339
02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:12.120
I know there's someone there.

1340
02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:15.160
Who's there?

1341
02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:17.160
Who are you?

1342
02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:21.560
Just give me a sign.

1343
02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:25.480
Come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

1344
02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:26.920
Will you give me a sign?

1345
02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:30.760
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

1346
02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:40.040
I know you've been controlling me.

1347
02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:42.240
Stefan, you're ill.

1348
02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:45.000
We need to go and see Dr. Haynes
and see if she can help.

1349
02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:53.200
<i>Remember, Stefan.</i>

1350
02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:56.120
Any time you need me,
you know the number.

1351
02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:02.800
- You heard it here first.
- Get a pen.

1352
02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:05.480
If you listen closely,
you can hear the numbers.

1353
02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:08.480
- Too?
- Good to be true.

1354
02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:10.040
<i>You sound like my dad.</i>

1355
02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:11.040
Oh.

1356
02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:12.960
<i>Five.</i>

1357
02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:15.440
You were five years old.

1358
02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:19.040
- One for all and all...
- For one.

1359
02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:20.280
<i>Remember, Stefan.</i>

1360
02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:23.080
Anytime you need me,
you know the number.

1361
02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:27.040
Number? What's the number?

1362
02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:29.760
Two. Oh. Five.

1363
02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:31.440
Four, one.

1364
02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:34.360
Remember...

1365
02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:38.720
<i>- Two. Oh. Five.</i>
<i>- Four, one.</i>

1366
02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:00.640
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>has not been recognized.</i>

1367
02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:02.480
<i>Please check and try again.</i>

1368
02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.120
<i>The number you have dialed has...</i>

1369
02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:19.600
<i>So Bandersnatch? Yay or nay?</i>

1370
02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:21.640
<i>Well, nothing in the game</i>
<i>is as fascinating</i>

1371
02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:23.880
<i>as its grisly real-life backstory.</i>

1372
02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:26.800
<i>As you know, Leslie, Stefan Butler,</i>
<i>the young man who wrote this,</i>

1373
02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:29.200
<i>had a breakdown</i>
<i>and murdered his own father.</i>

1374
02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:30.200
<i>Yes, very sad.</i>

1375
02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:32.640
<i>And it seems the code</i>
<i>was never quite finished</i>

1376
02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:34.480
<i>but Tuckersoft</i>
<i>just released the game anyway.</i>

1377
02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.560
<i>Which I know isn't a crime</i>
<i>on a par with murder</i>

1378
02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:38.440
<i>but it's still pretty off nonetheless.</i>

1379
02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:40.160
<i>Quite. So your verdict?</i>

1380
02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:41.760
<i>Two and a half stars out of five.</i>

1381
02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:45.480
<i>It's morbid curiosity value at best.</i>
<i>Must try harder.</i>

1382
02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:54.480
I keep thinking about that morning.

1383
02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:58.480
Reliving it.

1384
02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:02.600
<i>Rabbit. It was because of Rabbit.</i>

1385
02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:05.760
<i>He was this stupid toy that my mum</i>
<i>had made him when I was born,</i>

1386
02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:08.480
I used to take him everywhere.

1387
02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:11.880
I think Dad thought it was sissy
or something.

1388
02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:16.640
<i>He and Mum used to</i>
<i>have these rows about it.</i>

1389
02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:19.680
<i>And by five</i>
<i>he should've stopped playing with dolls.</i>

1390
02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:23.080
<i>I know he took Rabbit away</i>
<i>and hid it somewhere.</i>

1391
02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:29.200
<i>That morning, Mum was going</i>
<i>to visit Granddad and Grandma.</i>

1392
02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:33.040
<i>I was supposed to be going with her,</i>
<i>but I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.</i>

1393
02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:35.080
<i>I refused to go without him.</i>

1394
02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:36.920
Come on, Stefan, we're going to be late.

1395
02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:39.320
Are you coming or not?

1396
02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:51.040
No!

1397
02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:54.680
Come on.
You'll have to catch the 8:45, now.

1398
02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:58.160
<i>So I held her up.</i>

1399
02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:02.360
<i>Because of me she had to catch</i>
<i>a later train. Because of me.</i>

1400
02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:06.960
Stefan, how old were you
when this happened?

1401
02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:10.400
Five.

1402
02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:13.440

1411

The past is immutable, Stefan.

1412
02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:53.080
No matter how painful it is,
we can't change things,

1413
02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:56.000
we can't choose differently,
with hindsight.

1414
02:07:56.840 --> 02:07:59.080
And we all have to learn to accept that.

1415
02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:07.320
Remember. Any time you need me,
just pick up the phone.

1416
02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.240
You know the number.

1417
02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:22.880
<i>Stefan?</i>

1418
02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:26.160
Is everything alright?

1419
02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:36.320
Stefan?

1420
02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:38.240
Will you talk to me?

1421
02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:45.000
Look, I can't help you if you just
sit there and don't speak!

1422
02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:48.800
I keep thinking about that morning.

1423
02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:52.760

No.

1463

02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:43.160
Going over things again and again.

1465
02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:45.200
Think carefully.

1466
02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:48.280
You really might learn something new.

1467
02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:51.160
So I'll ask again.

1468
02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:55.400
Would you like to talk about
what happened with your mother?

1469
02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:05.600

you don't know.

1499
02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:03.320
The past is immutable, Stefan.

1500
02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:08.360
No matter how painful it is,
we can't change things,

1501
02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:11.320
we can't choose differently,
with hindsight.

1502
02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:14.360
And we all have to learn to accept that.

1503
02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:22.600
Remember. Any time you need me,
just pick up the phone.

1504
02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:24.720
You know the number.

1505
02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:38.240
<i>Stefan?</i>

1506
02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:41.280
Is everything alright?

1507
02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:51.600
Stefan?

1508
02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:53.520
Will you talk to me?

1509
02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.280
Look, I can't help you if you just
sit there and don't speak!

1510
02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:04.280
I keep thinking about that morning.

1511
02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:08.240
Reliving it.

1512
02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:12.240
<i>Rabbit. It was because of Rabbit.</i>

1513
02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:15.400
<i>He was this stupid toy that my mum</i>
<i>had made for me when I was born.</i>

1514
02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:18.080
I used to take him everywhere.

1515
02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:21.360
I think Dad thought it was sissy
or something.

1516
02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:26.240
<i>He and Mum used to have</i>
<i>these rows about it.</i>

1517
02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:29.280
And by five
he should've stopped playing with dolls.

1518
02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:32.720
<i>I know he took Rabbit away</i>
<i>and hid it somewhere.</i>

1519
02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:38.840
<i>That morning, Mum was going</i>
<i>to visit Granddad and Grandma.</i>

1520
02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:42.680
<i>I was supposed to be going with her,</i>
<i>but I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.</i>

1521
02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:44.720
<i>I refused to go without him.</i>

1522
02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:46.560
Come on, Stefan,
we're going to be late.

1523
02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:49.160
Are you coming or not?

1524
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.040
No!

1525
02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:04.200
Come on.
You'll have to catch the 8:45, now.

1526
02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:07.800
<i>So I held her up.</i>

1527
02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:12.000
<i>Because of me she had to catch</i>
<i>a later train. Because of me.</i>

1528
02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:16.440
Stefan, how old were you
when this happened?

1529
02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:20.600
Five.

1530
02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:23.520
You were five years old.

1531
02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:25.400
And you couldn't have known.

1532
02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:27.600
Stefan.

1533
02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:30.560
You couldn't have known.

1534
02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:36.400
<i>The Emergency Services say</i>
<i>the 8:45 train derailed at high speed</i>

1535
02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:39.080
<i>outside Queenstown Road Station.</i>

1536
02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:46.320
<i>As the death toll continues to rise,</i>
<i>transport police have opened an inquiry</i>

1537
02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:48.920
<i>But the cause is not yet clear.</i>

1538
02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:53.640
I fucking hate him for it.

1539
02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:57.560
The past is immutable, Stefan.

1540
02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:02.720
No matter how painful it is,
we can't change things,

1541
02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:05.680
we can't choose differently,
with hindsight.

1542
02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:08.720
And we all have to learn to accept that.

1543
02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:17.120
Remember. Any time you need me,
just pick up the phone.

1544
02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:19.080
You know the number.

1545
02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:37.800
<i>Is everything alright?</i>

1546
02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:43.520
Stefan? Will you talk to me?

1547
02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:45.160
Dad, just fuck off!

1548
02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:49.760
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

1549
02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:55.120
- This is Dr. Haynes' place.
- You need to speak to her.

1550
02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:59.760
You're under pressure.
You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

1551
02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:48.360
Looking good.
Good job I doubled the advertising.

1552
02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:54.000
That's not...

1553
02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:57.160
Stefan, mate. This is due today.
You said it was stable.

1554
02:18:57.240 --> 02:18:58.880
- It was, I just...
- Just what?

1555
02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:02.840
- Did you add a new path?
- The government conspiracy branch.

1556
02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:05.720
One of the alternate timelines
in the novel.

1557
02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:08.040
Jerome F. Davies
was into his conspiracy theories.

1558
02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:11.560
- Before or after he went psycho?
- I thought I'd tied up all the loose ends.

1559
02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:14.320
If it's something you've added,
let's just take it out.

1560
02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:17.720
- No, it's important.
- Stefan, mate. The deadline is today.

1561
02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:19.760
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path in.

1562
02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:23.280
- It's complicated enough.
- Just the weekend. Please.

1563
02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:28.640
- First thing Monday.
- First thing.

1564
02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:30.120
OK.

1565
02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:32.680
Shit, I've got to run,
meeting the John Menzies guys.

1566
02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:37.240
Just don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

1567
02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:38.680
I know.

1568
02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:44.560
Here. That's for you.

1569
02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:47.240
What is it?

1570
02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:50.280
Taped it off the telly.
Documentary about Jerome.

1571
02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:53.800
Bit of inspiration maybe.
Pop it on while you work.

1572
02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:20.880
You having a film night?

1573
02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:34.920
<i>- They're great!</i>
<i>- Kellogg's Frosties.</i>

<i>Towards the end of his life,</i>

1575
02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:46.240
<i>Davies was apparently self-administering</i>
<i>hallucinogens on a daily basis.</i>

1576
02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:48.200
<i>This, coupled with his attempts</i>

<i>to complete the complex multiple</i>
<i>narratives of</i> Bandersnatch

1578

1579
02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:56.360
<i>He became obsessed</i>
<i>with bizarre symbols</i>

02:20:56.440 --> 02:20:59.240
<i>and the limitations</i>
<i>of his own free will.</i>

1581
02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:03.080
<i>In his notes,</i>
<i>Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph</i>

1582
02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:08.360
<i>which to him represented multiple fates,</i>
<i>potential realities splitting in two.</i>

1583
02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:13.240
<i>It was the start</i>
<i>of his complete mental collapse.</i>

1584
02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:16.760
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate</i>

1585
02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:20.160

<i>with psychoactive drugs</i>

1658
02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:41.800
Just don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

1659
02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:43.040
I know.

1660
02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:49.120
Here. That's for you.

1661
02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:51.800
What is it?

1662
02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:54.840
Taped it off the telly.
Documentary about Jerome.

1663
02:27:54.920 --> 02:27:58.480
Bit of inspiration maybe.
Pop it on while you work.

1664
02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:25.640
You having a film night?

1665
02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:37.040
<i>Sugar Puffs from Quaker.</i>

1666
02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:39.480
<i>Tell them about the honey... Yummy!</i>

1667
02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:46.040
<i>Towards the end of his life,</i>

1668
02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:50.800
<i>Davies was apparently self-administering</i>
<i>hallucinogens on a daily basis.</i>

1669
02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:52.760
<i>This, coupled with his attempts</i>

1670
02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:55.960
<i>to complete the complex multiple</i>
<i>narratives of</i> Bandersnatch

1671
02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:58.280
<i>was to prove the final straw.</i>

1672
02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:00.920
<i>He became obsessed</i>
<i>with bizarre symbols</i>

1673
02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.840
<i>and the limitations</i>
<i>of his own free will.</i>

1674
02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:07.640
<i>In his notes,</i>
<i>Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph</i>

1675
02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:12.920
<i>which to him represented multiple fates,</i>
<i>potential realities splitting in two.</i>

1676
02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:17.800
<i>It was the start</i>
<i>of his complete mental collapse.</i>

1677
02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:21.320
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate</i>

1678
02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:24.720
<i>because his wife was spiking him</i>
<i>with psychoactive drugs</i>

1679
02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:29.920
<i>at the behest of a demon called Pax,</i>
<i>a sort of lion figure,</i>

1680
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:31.280
<i>he claimed he'd seen in a vision,</i>

1681
02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:33.920
<i>and who ended up</i>
<i>being incorporated into the book.</i>

1682
02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:39.320
<i>It was this that led him to kill her.</i>

1683
02:29:40.200 --> 02:29:44.560
<i>He decapitated her and daubed the</i>
<i>glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.</i>

1684
02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:49.080
<i>After his arrest, he told police</i>

1685
02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:53.280
<i>we exist within</i>
<i>multiple parallel realities at once.</i>

1686
02:29:53.640 --> 02:29:57.960
<i>One reality for each possible course</i>
<i>of action we might take in life.</i>

1687
02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:00.800
<i>Whatever we choose to do</i>
<i>in this existence,</i>

1688
02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:04.160
<i>there’s another one out there</i>
<i>in which we’re doing quite the opposite,</i>

1689
02:30:04.240 --> 02:30:09.080
<i>which renders free will meaningless.</i>
<i>Nothing but an illusion.</i>

1690
02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:55.880
We can't dupe them fast enough.
Everybody wants a bit of Colin Ritman.

1691
02:30:57.880 --> 02:31:01.000
- Er, where is Colin?
- God knows. He's gone AWOL.

1692
02:31:01.080 --> 02:31:02.480
He hasn't come in,
hasn't answered his phone.

1693
02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:04.080
Par for the course from him.

1694
02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:06.240
He's probably fucked off to Amsterdam
for a spot of gardening.

1695
02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:08.760
He'll be back, he always is.
Anyway, come on.

1696
02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:22.600
Looking good.
Good thing I doubled on the advertising.

1697
02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:30.640
That's not...

1698
02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:33.520
Stefan, mate. This is due today.
You said it was stable.

1699
02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:35.640
- It was, it was. I just...
- Just what?

1700
02:31:36.200 --> 02:31:38.200
I added a new path,
the government conspiracy branch.

1701
02:31:38.280 --> 02:31:39.440
I thought I'd tied up all the loose ends.

1702
02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:41.400
If it's something you've added,
let's just take it out.

1703
02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:45.840
- No, it's important.
- Stefan, mate. The deadline is today.

1704
02:31:45.920 --> 02:31:49.480
I just need the weekend.
I know I can squeeze this path in.

1705
02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:52.160
- It's complicated enough.
- Just the weekend. Please.

1706
02:31:55.880 --> 02:31:57.520
- First thing Monday.
- First thing.

1707
02:31:57.600 --> 02:31:58.440

Er... Colin wanted me to give you this.

1712
02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:18.040
What is it?

1713
02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:20.960
He said he taped it off the telly,

1714
02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:26.600

- No. Sorry.

1815
02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:20.280
What is it?

1816
02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:23.200
He said he taped it off the telly,
to inspire you.

1817
02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:28.840
- Do you know where Colin is?
- No, sorry.

1818
02:41:55.800 --> 02:41:57.280
You having a film night?

1819
02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:08.800
<i>Sugar Puffs from Quaker.</i>

1820
02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:11.240
<i>Tell them about the honey... Yummy!</i>

1821
02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:17.760
<i>Towards the end of his life,</i>

1822
02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:22.560
<i>Davies was apparently self-administering</i>
<i>hallucinogens on a daily basis.</i>

1823
02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:24.520
<i>This, coupled with his attempts</i>

1824
02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:27.720
<i>to complete the complex multiple</i>
<i>narratives of</i> Bandersnatch

1825
02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:30.080
<i>was to prove the final straw.</i>

1826
02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:32.640
<i>He became obsessed</i>
<i>with bizarre symbols</i>

1827
02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:35.560
<i>and the limitations</i>
<i>of his own free will.</i>

1828
02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:39.400
<i>In his notes,</i>
<i>Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph</i>

1829
02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:44.680
<i>which to him represented multiple fates,</i>
<i>potential realities splitting in two.</i>

1830
02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:49.560
<i>It was the start</i>
<i>of his complete mental collapse.</i>

1831
02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:53.080
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate</i>

1832
02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:56.480
<i>because his wife was spiking him</i>
<i>with psychoactive drugs</i>

1833
02:42:56.920 --> 02:43:01.520
<i>at behest of a demon called Pax,</i>
<i>a sort of lion figure,</i>

1834
02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:03.040
<i>he claimed he'd seen in a vision,</i>

1835
02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:05.720
<i>and who ended up</i>
<i>being incorporated into the book.</i>

1836
02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:11.080
<i>It was this that led him to kill her.</i>

1837
02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:16.320
<i>He decapitated her and daubed the</i>
<i>glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.</i>

1838
02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:20.440
<i>After his arrest, he told police</i>

1839
02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:25.000
<i>we exist within</i>
<i>multiple parallel realities at once.</i>

1840
02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:29.840
<i>One reality for each possible course</i>
<i>of action we might take in life.</i>

1841
02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:32.560
<i>Whatever we choose to do</i>
<i>in this existence,</i>

1842
02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:35.880
<i>there’s another one out there</i>
<i>in which we’re doing quite the opposite,</i>

1843
02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:40.640
<i>which renders free will meaningless.</i>
<i>Nothing but an illusion.</i>

1844
02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:11.080
Who's doing this to me?

1845
02:50:12.480 --> 02:50:13.960
I know there's someone there.

1846
02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:17.000

<i>Yes, and so what, Rabbit is a toy.</i>

1854

1856
02:52:05.680 --> 02:52:07.800

- First thing Monday.
- First thing.

1932

- Skip to the next bit.
- What?

1933
03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:21.600
For fuck's sake, I'll skip it for you.

03:09:22.280 --> 03:09:25.760
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

1979
03:09:40.840 --> 03:09:44.600
We can't dupe them fast enough.
Everybody wants a bit of Colin Ritman.

1980
03:09:44.680 --> 03:09:46.440
- Where is Colin?
- He's gone AWOL.

1981
03:09:46.520 --> 03:09:47.720
Probably fucked off to Amsterdam

1982
03:09:47.800 --> 03:09:49.240
for a spot of gardening,
if you know what I mean.

1983
03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:50.360
He'll be back, he always is.

1984
03:09:52.240 --> 03:09:53.520
Mate. This is due today.

1985
03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:55.680
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path.

1986
03:09:55.760 --> 03:09:59.040
Don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

1987
03:09:59.120 --> 03:10:00.040
I know.

1988
03:10:02.720 --> 03:10:07.160
Er... Colin wanted me to give you this,
to inspire you.

1989
03:10:08.480 --> 03:10:11.720
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate.</i>

1990
03:10:11.800 --> 03:10:15.680
<i>because his wife was spiking him</i>
<i>with psychoactive drugs.</i>

1991
03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:17.720
<i>After his arrest, he told police</i>

1992
03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:21.920
<i>we exist within multiple</i>
<i>parallel realities at once.</i>

1993
03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:26.520
<i>One reality for each possible course</i>
<i>of action we might take in life.</i>

1994
03:10:26.600 --> 03:10:28.680
<i>Whatever we choose to do</i>
<i>in this existence,</i>

1995
03:10:28.760 --> 03:10:32.200
<i>there’s another one out there</i>
<i>in which we’re doing quite the opposite.</i>

1996
03:10:34.680 --> 03:10:36.640
I said no and I meant it.

1997
03:10:36.720 --> 03:10:38.360
OK, well...

1998
03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:42.120
Remember, Stefan, anytime you need me...

1999
03:10:42.200 --> 03:10:43.400
Just call.

2000
03:10:45.440 --> 03:10:46.720
You know the number.

2001
03:10:59.800 --> 03:11:00.880
<i>Stefan.</i>

2002
03:11:02.280 --> 03:11:03.840
Is everything alright?

2003
03:11:13.120 --> 03:11:16.080
Stefan? Will you talk to me?

2004
03:11:20.560 --> 03:11:22.840
Look, I can't help if you just sit there
and don't speak!

2005
03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:25.400
I said no and I meant it.

2006

03:11:28.040 --> 03:11:30.880
Remember, Stefan, anytime you need me...

2008
03:11:30.960 --> 03:11:32.000
Just call.

2009
03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:35.680
You know the number.

2010
03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:02.720
Stefan?

2011

Will you talk to me.

- Remember, Stefan, anytime you need me...
- Just call.

You know the number.

2017

Is everything alright?

2018
03:12:47.480 --> 03:12:49.240
Stefan, will you talk to me.

2019
03:12:49.320 --> 03:12:50.880
Dad, just fuck off!

2020
03:12:52.680 --> 03:12:55.280
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

2021
03:12:56.480 --> 03:12:58.400
I said no and I meant it.

2022
03:12:58.920 --> 03:13:00.440

Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

Stefan?

2034
03:17:13.360 --> 03:17:14.200
Tea.

2035
03:17:17.680 --> 03:17:20.360
Look, I'm gonna go to the pub
for some lunch.

2036
03:17:20.640 --> 03:17:22.760
If you fancy tagging along...

2037
03:17:23.440 --> 03:17:24.280
No, I'm alright.

2038
03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:27.840
You didn't have any breakfast.

2039
03:17:27.920 --> 03:17:30.240
Dad. I'm fine.

2040
03:17:32.520 --> 03:17:33.920
Is everything alright?

2041
03:17:40.400 --> 03:17:43.680
Stefan, I'm worried about you.
You've been stuck in your room for weeks.

2042
03:17:50.080 --> 03:17:51.080
Stefan?

2043
03:17:52.120 --> 03:17:53.040
Will you talk to me?

2044
03:17:57.520 --> 03:17:59.800
Look, I can't help if you just sit there

2045
03:18:23.520 --> 03:18:24.720
Who's doing this to me?

I know there's someone there.

2047
03:18:29.560 --> 03:18:30.800
Who's there?

2048
03:18:31.480 --> 03:18:32.720
Who are you?

2049
03:18:35.240 --> 03:18:36.880
Just give me a sign.

2050
03:18:38.640 --> 03:18:40.960
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

Come on, Stefan. Come on.

03:22:01.440 --> 03:22:04.320
- You can find Rabbit later.
- No!

2064
03:22:05.960 --> 03:22:07.600
Stefan, please come with me.

2065

No!

2066

You weren't supposed to know.

2068
03:22:36.400 --> 03:22:37.360
I'm sorry.

Talk to me!

2108
03:28:55.200 --> 03:28:57.000
We've talked about this before,
I'm sure we have.

2109
03:28:57.080 --> 03:28:58.920
So just write me the fucking prescription.

2110
03:29:18.240 --> 03:29:20.760
<i>The government put drugs</i>
<i>in your food and they film you.</i>

2111

- First thing Monday.
- First thing.

2112
03:30:11.560 --> 03:30:14.160
- Skip to the next bit.
- What?

2113
03:30:14.960 --> 03:30:16.960
For fuck's sake, I'll skip it for you.

2123
03:31:13.760 --> 03:31:15.520
Stefan, mate. This is due today.

2124
03:31:15.600 --> 03:31:17.800
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path.

2125
03:31:17.880 --> 03:31:21.120
Don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate.</i>

<i>If you follow that line of thinking,</i>

2128
03:31:27.440 --> 03:31:29.960

2129
03:31:30.720 --> 03:31:33.920
<i>They're not even your actions.</i>
<i>It's out of your control.</i>

2130

2131
03:31:36.360 --> 03:31:37.920
<i>So, why not commit murder?</i>

2132
03:31:39.640 --> 03:31:40.800
<i>You're not in control.</i>

2133
03:34:03.240 --> 03:34:04.240
Stefan.

2134

You're in the hole. Come with me.

2135
03:34:06.960 --> 03:34:08.480
Stefan, this is Kitty.

2136
03:34:09.520 --> 03:34:11.960
And this is Pearl, Daddy's little legacy.

2137
03:34:14.200 --> 03:34:16.000
One for you, one for me.

2138
03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:23.040
There's messages in every game.
Like Pac-Man.

2139
03:34:23.120 --> 03:34:24.320
You know what PAC stands for?

2140
03:34:24.440 --> 03:34:27.520
Program and Control.
He's Program and Control Man.

2141
03:34:27.600 --> 03:34:30.080
It's not a happy game,
it's a fucking nightmare world.

2142
03:34:31.440 --> 03:34:34.160
I've given you the knowledge.
I've set you free.

2143
03:34:35.960 --> 03:34:37.760
One of us is jumping.

2144
03:34:37.880 --> 03:34:39.200
So, who's it going to be?

2145
03:34:44.840 --> 03:34:46.480
There's a nice breeze up here.

2146
03:34:49.880 --> 03:34:50.840
So come on.

2147
03:34:52.320 --> 03:34:53.840
Which one of us is jumping?

2148
03:35:08.200 --> 03:35:09.040
Breakfast?

2149
03:35:10.480 --> 03:35:12.000
- Your Bander-what?
- Bandersnatch.

2150
03:35:12.080 --> 03:35:14.800
- It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.
- The bloody hound from next door.

2151
03:35:15.040 --> 03:35:15.880
Be the death of us.

2152
03:35:24.880 --> 03:35:27.360
- We're going to be a hit factory.
- Colin Ritman?

2153
03:35:27.600 --> 03:35:29.720
That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

2154
03:35:29.800 --> 03:35:32.920
The state of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini,

2155
03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:36.400
and he still smokes roll-ups.

2156
03:35:41.360 --> 03:35:42.560
We've met before.

2157
03:35:43.680 --> 03:35:45.560
- No.
- We met before.

2158
03:35:45.640 --> 03:35:48.800
I told you I'd see you around.
And I was right.

2159
03:35:51.520 --> 03:35:53.560
- This is what I'm working on.
- Nohzdyve.

2160
03:35:53.920 --> 03:35:55.000
Hm-hm.

2161
03:35:58.600 --> 03:35:59.680
Oh, bollocks.

2162
03:35:59.760 --> 03:36:01.040
- What's that?
- Buffer error.

2163
03:36:01.640 --> 03:36:03.960
The eyeball sprites
overshot the video memory.

2164
03:36:04.600 --> 03:36:05.560
Yep.

2165
03:36:06.840 --> 03:36:09.360
Don't worship him,
he's the Thief of Destiny.

2166
03:36:09.440 --> 03:36:12.240
- You've read<i> Bandersnatch?</i>
- Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

2167
03:36:12.520 --> 03:36:14.800
Was he that bloke who went cuckoo
and cut his wife's head off?

2168
03:36:15.320 --> 03:36:17.040
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

2169
03:36:17.240 --> 03:36:18.560
Excuse me.

2170
03:36:22.200 --> 03:36:25.080
- What's happened?
- I haven't programmed that path yet.

2171
03:36:25.560 --> 03:36:27.280
Lot of divergent realities in that book.

2172
03:36:27.800 --> 03:36:29.240
It was ahead of its time.

2173
03:36:29.760 --> 03:36:31.440
In as much as time exists.

2174
03:36:32.280 --> 03:36:35.000
OK. So, here's my proposal.

2175
03:36:35.440 --> 03:36:36.680
Come and write it here.

2176
03:36:37.800 --> 03:36:39.520
- Here?
- We'll give you a couple of desks,

2177
03:36:39.600 --> 03:36:41.240
set up a small team, just for you.

2178
03:36:41.320 --> 03:36:42.720
And of course Col's on hand.

2179
03:36:43.640 --> 03:36:44.680
What do you reckon?

2180
03:36:45.760 --> 03:36:48.000
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring
this sound chip guy next week,

2181
03:36:48.080 --> 03:36:50.360
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

2182
03:36:50.840 --> 03:36:53.200
So, come on, what's your answer?

2183
03:37:00.040 --> 03:37:01.320
Who's doing this to me?

2184
03:37:02.640 --> 03:37:04.040
I know there's someone there.

2185
03:37:06.120 --> 03:37:07.320
Who's there?

2186
03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:09.320
Who are you?

2187
03:37:11.760 --> 03:37:13.640
Just give me a sign.

2188
03:37:15.080 --> 03:37:17.560
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

2189
03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:19.000
Will you give me a sign?

2190
03:37:19.480 --> 03:37:22.920
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

2191
03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:33.320
Who's doing this to me?

2192
03:37:34.600 --> 03:37:36.040
I know there's someone there.

2193
03:37:38.080 --> 03:37:39.280
Who's there?

2194
03:37:39.960 --> 03:37:41.280
Who are you?

2195
03:37:43.720 --> 03:37:45.440
Just give me a sign.

2196
03:37:47.160 --> 03:37:49.480
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

2197
03:37:49.560 --> 03:37:50.960
Will you give me a sign?

2198
03:37:51.480 --> 03:37:54.880
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

2199
03:38:00.560 --> 03:38:02.320
Oh, God, really?

2200
03:38:07.480 --> 03:38:08.520
Dr. Haynes' office.

2201
03:38:09.480 --> 03:38:11.120
Is Dr. Haynes there?

2202
03:38:11.200 --> 03:38:13.160
<i>No,</i>
<i>she's with a client right now.</i>

2203
03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:18.440
<i>Would you like to make an appointment?</i>
<i>I could fit you in first thing tomorrow.</i>

2204
03:38:19.320 --> 03:38:20.200
Yes.

2205
03:38:20.960 --> 03:38:24.080
- <i>And your name is?</i>
- Stefan Butler.

2206
03:38:27.840 --> 03:38:31.520
Where's Colin?
Where is he? Where is he?

2207
03:38:31.600 --> 03:38:33.840
- Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?
- It's Colin's girlfriend.

2208
03:38:33.920 --> 03:38:35.280
Kitty. We've met before.

2209
03:38:36.120 --> 03:38:38.440
When you had blue hair.
Satpal, I'll deal with this.

2210
03:38:38.920 --> 03:38:40.640
- Where's Colin?
- I thought you'd tell me.

2211
03:38:40.720 --> 03:38:42.080
He's gone, he's just gone.

2212
03:38:42.520 --> 03:38:44.480
Tell me about it
but he's done this before.

2213
03:38:44.920 --> 03:38:47.360
Not like this. When did you see him last?

2214
03:38:47.560 --> 03:38:50.080
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

2215
03:38:51.120 --> 03:38:52.000
Who's Stefan?

2216
03:38:52.200 --> 03:38:53.800
Let's leave Stefan out of this,
he's working.

2217
03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:55.680
Who's Stefan?

2218
03:38:56.320 --> 03:38:57.920
And how is your father?

2219
03:38:59.200 --> 03:39:02.040
He's visiting his sister.
She's in the South of France, so...

2220
03:39:02.360 --> 03:39:04.280
So you've been left to your own devices.

2221
03:39:05.240 --> 03:39:07.720
Hm-hm.

2222
03:39:15.800 --> 03:39:17.160
It's been good actually.

2223
03:39:18.280 --> 03:39:19.360
Not having him.

2224
03:39:21.280 --> 03:39:23.760
<i>It's meant I could work</i>
<i>with a real sense of purpose.</i>

2225
03:39:27.520 --> 03:39:29.520
<i>I've actually had a bit of breakthrough</i>
<i>with the game.</i>

2226
03:39:30.640 --> 03:39:33.560
<i>I think I'd got bogged down before,</i>

2227
03:39:34.680 --> 03:39:35.920
<i>but now I can see.</i>

2228
03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:37.520
<i> So you finally finished it?</i>

2229
03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:41.400
<i>Finished, delivered, everything.</i>

2230
03:39:41.960 --> 03:39:44.320
<i>I'd been trying to give the player</i>
<i>too much choice.</i>

2231
03:39:44.640 --> 03:39:47.240
<i>So I just went back</i>
<i>and stripped loads out.</i>

2232
03:39:48.080 --> 03:39:51.480
<i>And now they've only got the illusion</i>
<i>of free will, but really,</i>

2233
03:39:52.000 --> 03:39:53.600
I decide the ending.

2234
03:39:56.240 --> 03:39:58.040
And is it a happy ending?

2235
03:39:59.560 --> 03:40:02.400
- I think so.
- Then that's great.

2236
03:40:27.760 --> 03:40:29.560
Oh, God, really?

2237
03:40:34.720 --> 03:40:35.760
Dr. Haynes' office.

2238
03:40:36.840 --> 03:40:38.360

- <i>And your name is?</i>
<i>- </i>Stefan Butler.

2243
03:40:55.040 --> 03:40:58.760
Where's Colin?
Where is he? Where is he?

2244
03:40:58.840 --> 03:41:01.080
- Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?
- It's Colin's girlfriend.

- <i>And your name is?</i>
- Stefan Butler.

2277
03:43:18.640 --> 03:43:21.120
He's fucking engaged.

2278
03:43:22.480 --> 03:43:24.240
He's probably taken the phone
off the hook.

2279
03:43:26.400 --> 03:43:28.920
- That's what I do.
- That's what you do, is it?

2280
03:43:29.320 --> 03:43:30.400
I'll remember that.

2281
03:43:32.880 --> 03:43:35.440
Look, just let him be.

2282
03:43:36.120 --> 03:43:38.120
He's probably in the zone.

2283
03:43:38.200 --> 03:43:41.520
OK.
I'll give him another twenty-four hours.

2284
03:44:01.400 --> 03:44:02.840

OK.

2301
03:45:41.160 --> 03:45:43.800
- Hello?
- The man himself, the whiz kid.

2302
03:45:43.960 --> 03:45:45.080
<i>How's it going?</i>

2303
03:45:46.400 --> 03:45:47.480
"How's it going?"

2304
03:45:47.960 --> 03:45:50.440
Have I dialed an echo by mistake?

2305
03:45:50.560 --> 03:45:53.400
Wakey-wakey. Bandersnatch.
The game you promised us.

2306
03:45:53.800 --> 03:45:55.120
<i>First thing Monday you said.</i>

2307
03:45:55.440 --> 03:45:57.080
I need the code.

2308
03:45:57.160 --> 03:45:59.360
The ads are out,
I've booked the dupe plant.

2309
03:45:59.440 --> 03:46:02.440
There's some serious cash down
the swanny if you don't deliver.

2310
03:46:03.280 --> 03:46:05.400
I need it by the end of today.
That possible?

2311
03:46:07.560 --> 03:46:09.960
<i>Stefan? Hello?</i>

2312
03:46:10.400 --> 03:46:11.240
<i>Spit it out.</i>

2313
03:46:11.560 --> 03:46:12.920
Before I evolve.

2314
03:46:16.960 --> 03:46:19.440
Will it be ready by the end of today?

2315
03:46:22.080 --> 03:46:23.680
- Of course.
<i>- Good.</i>

2316
03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:26.720
By the end of today, no later. Tatty bye.

2317
03:46:28.440 --> 03:46:31.720
You shouldn't rush him.
He needs to explore all possibilities.

2318
03:46:32.160 --> 03:46:34.280
He said he's delivering
by the end of today.

2319
03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:35.840
So, that's good then.

2320
03:46:36.080 --> 03:46:37.080
He's bullshitting.

2321
03:46:37.160 --> 03:46:39.880
Why don't you head round there. See what's
really going on. Give him a hand.

2322
03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:43.320
Come on. Now get your feet off my table.

2323
03:46:43.520 --> 03:46:46.080
This isn't one of your anarchist communes.
This is a place of work.

2324
03:46:50.720 --> 03:46:51.560
OK.

2325
03:47:00.360 --> 03:47:01.200
Yeah, end of the day.

2326
03:47:06.400 --> 03:47:09.720
You shouldn't rush him.
He needs to explore all possibilities.

2327
03:47:10.200 --> 03:47:12.320
He said he's delivering
by the end of today.

2328
03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:15.120
- So, that's good then.
- He's bullshitting.

2329
03:47:15.200 --> 03:47:17.880
Why don't you head round there. See what's
really going on. Give him a hand.

2330
03:47:18.960 --> 03:47:21.320
Come on. Now get your feet off my table.

2331
03:47:21.520 --> 03:47:24.080
This isn't one of your anarchist communes.
This is a place of work.

2332
03:47:28.720 --> 03:47:29.560
OK.

2333
03:47:38.280 --> 03:47:39.200
Yeah, end of the day.

2334
03:47:43.640 --> 03:47:47.280
Where's Colin?
Where is he? Where is he?

2335
03:47:47.360 --> 03:47:49.600
- Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?
- It's Colin's girlfriend.

2336
03:47:49.680 --> 03:47:51.040
Kitty. We've met before.

2337
03:47:51.880 --> 03:47:54.200
When you had blue hair.
Satpal, I'll deal with this.

2338
03:47:54.480 --> 03:47:55.320
Where's Colin?

2339
03:47:55.400 --> 03:47:57.840
- I thought you'd tell me.
- He's gone, he's just gone.

2340
03:47:58.280 --> 03:48:00.240
Tell me about it,
but he's done this before.

2341
03:48:00.800 --> 03:48:03.120
Not like this. When did you see him last?

2342
03:48:03.360 --> 03:48:05.200
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

2343
03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:07.760
Who's Stefan?

2344
03:48:07.960 --> 03:48:09.560
Let's leave Stefan out of this,
he's working.

2345
03:48:10.080 --> 03:48:11.520
Who's Stefan?

2346
03:48:13.040 --> 03:48:13.920
OK.

2347
03:48:23.200 --> 03:48:24.360
Fucker hung up.

2348
03:48:25.520 --> 03:48:27.440
He's trying to work.

2349
03:48:27.680 --> 03:48:29.120
Oh, work it up your dirt box.

2350
03:48:30.320 --> 03:48:31.400
That's not constructive.

2351
03:48:31.960 --> 03:48:33.680
No one hangs up on me.

2352
03:48:40.720 --> 03:48:41.560
OK.

2353
03:48:50.800 --> 03:48:52.200
Fucking fuck!

2354
03:48:52.400 --> 03:48:56.080
Where's Colin?
Where is he? Where is he?

2355
03:48:56.160 --> 03:48:58.400
- Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?
- It's Colin's girlfriend.

2356
03:48:58.480 --> 03:48:59.840
Kitty. We've met before.

2357
03:49:00.640 --> 03:49:03.000

Satpal, I'll deal with this.

2358
03:49:03.280 --> 03:49:04.120

2359
03:49:04.200 --> 03:49:06.640

Let's leave Stefan out of this,

2365
03:49:18.840 --> 03:49:20.280
Who's Stefan?

2366
03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:23.960
- No.
- No?

2367
03:49:24.280 --> 03:49:25.960
Tough tit-holes.

2368
03:49:26.280 --> 03:49:28.040
<i>You signed a contract,</i>
<i>so don't be a pillock.</i>

2369
03:49:28.120 --> 03:49:29.280
<i>Pull your finger out.</i>

2370
03:49:29.680 --> 03:49:32.600
I expect it by the end of today. Sayonara!

2371
03:49:33.400 --> 03:49:37.200
Where's Colin?
Where is he? Where is he?

2372
03:49:37.280 --> 03:49:39.520
- Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?
- It's Colin's girlfriend.

2373
03:49:39.600 --> 03:49:40.960

- I thought you'd tell me.
- He's gone, he's just gone.

2377
03:49:48.200 --> 03:49:50.160
Tell me about it,
but he's done this before.

2378
03:49:50.720 --> 03:49:53.040
Not like this. When did you see him last?

2379
03:49:53.400 --> 03:49:55.120
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

2380
03:49:56.720 --> 03:49:57.680
Who's Stefan?

2381
03:49:57.760 --> 03:49:59.480
Let's leave Stefan out of this,
he's working.

2382
03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:01.440
Who's Stefan?

2383
03:50:20.680 --> 03:50:22.000
Well, you need a hand.

2384
03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:27.480
Come on, lead me to it.

2385
03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:31.800
- To what?
- Bandersnatch.

2386
03:50:32.400 --> 03:50:34.320
Where's your pit? Up there?

2387
03:50:44.320 --> 03:50:45.560
Fucking hell.

2388
03:50:46.280 --> 03:50:48.080
You've gone right down the hole, mate.

2389
03:50:48.960 --> 03:50:50.200
Right down it.

2390
03:50:57.520 --> 03:50:58.600
I killed my dad.

2391
03:51:00.720 --> 03:51:01.800
Right.

2392
03:51:04.960 --> 03:51:07.320
So are you gonna let me go,
or are you gonna kill me?

2393
03:51:14.200 --> 03:51:15.560
I mean, it's your choice.

2394
03:51:16.600 --> 03:51:18.400
In as much as you have any choice.

2395
03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:34.240
Imagine that's a bit
anti-climactic for you.

2396
03:51:35.960 --> 03:51:37.360
But appreciated.

2397
03:51:38.120 --> 03:51:39.640
I'm quite enjoying this lifetime.

2398
03:51:40.920 --> 03:51:42.040
See you in the next one.

2399
03:52:11.920 --> 03:52:15.040
So, that's how
the wireframe models of today

2400
03:52:15.120 --> 03:52:18.040
might provide the Hollywood entertainment
of the future.

2401
03:52:18.480 --> 03:52:20.600
- Crispin.
- Thanks, Leslie.

2402
03:52:21.440 --> 03:52:25.280
Now, yesterday, following weeks
of controversy and speculation,

2403
03:52:25.360 --> 03:52:29.480
games company Tuckersoft announced
it's going into administration.

2404
03:52:29.560 --> 03:52:30.680
<i>So, what went wrong?</i>

2405
03:52:31.440 --> 03:52:34.480
<i>Just six months ago,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

2406
03:52:34.560 --> 03:52:36.880
<i>with a string of hits topping the charts</i>

2407
03:52:36.960 --> 03:52:40.960
<i>and mounting anticipation for their big</i>
<i>Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

2408
03:52:41.440 --> 03:52:43.480
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

2409
03:52:43.560 --> 03:52:47.040
following the arrest and subsequent
murder charge against its creator,

2410
03:52:47.280 --> 03:52:49.480
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

2411
03:52:49.560 --> 03:52:52.000
<i>who stands accused</i>
<i>of murdering his father</i>

2412
03:52:52.080 --> 03:52:54.000
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

2413
03:52:54.080 --> 03:52:57.400
<i>This has raised questions</i>
<i>about the judgment</i>

2414
03:52:57.480 --> 03:52:59.480
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

2415
03:52:59.960 --> 03:53:02.800
It was his idea to do it alone.
His decision.

2416
03:53:02.880 --> 03:53:04.640
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

2417
03:53:05.000 --> 03:53:08.480
I mean, I know his dad's dead,
rest his soul,

2418
03:53:08.880 --> 03:53:12.480
but I'm a victim, too.
Let's try to not forget that.

2419
03:53:12.960 --> 03:53:17.000
<i>Another Tuckersoft protégé,</i>
<i>famed programmer Colin Ritman,</i>

2420
03:53:17.080 --> 03:53:21.400
<i>believes there are important lessons</i>
<i>to be learned from Butler's unravelling.</i>

2421
03:53:22.040 --> 03:53:24.640
What would you say to Stefan,
if he could hear you?

2422
03:53:25.840 --> 03:53:27.240
I'd say try again.

2423
03:53:28.240 --> 03:53:29.320
But he's in prison.

2424
03:53:30.480 --> 03:53:32.120
<i>Only in this life.</i>

2425
03:53:32.720 --> 03:53:35.400
<i>Shortly after this interview,</i>
<i>Colin Ritman was arrested</i>

2426
03:53:35.480 --> 03:53:37.720
<i>for possession of controlled substances.</i>

2427
03:53:37.800 --> 03:53:40.280
<i>Tuckersoft closed its doors for good.</i>

2428
03:53:40.560 --> 03:53:43.280
<i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

2429
03:54:50.200 --> 03:54:51.280
You look well.

2430
03:54:52.640 --> 03:54:55.040
- No. No, no, no, no.
- Show me what you've done then.

2431
03:54:55.120 --> 03:54:57.840
- I haven't done anything.
- You haven't done anything?

2432
03:54:58.120 --> 03:55:00.880
What are you expecting me to put out?
Fucking fart on a tape?

2433
03:55:01.160 --> 03:55:02.400
Merry Christmas, everybody.

2434
03:55:04.320 --> 03:55:07.280
Oh, the game.
The game. I've been doing that.

2435
03:55:07.360 --> 03:55:09.040
What is wrong with your skull?

2436
03:55:09.400 --> 03:55:11.720
Bloody hell. I mean,
I thought you were weird from day one,

2437
03:55:11.800 --> 03:55:14.000
but I don't know,
maybe you were just artistic.

2438
03:55:14.080 --> 03:55:15.200
Colin used to...

2439
03:55:17.640 --> 03:55:18.600
Oh.

2440
03:55:22.320 --> 03:55:23.160
Ah.

2441
03:55:26.920 --> 03:55:31.080
And that's why, one day,
we might play games against each other

2442
03:55:31.160 --> 03:55:34.320
using our computers, and a telephone.

2443
03:55:34.720 --> 03:55:37.080
- Crispin.
- Thanks, Leslie.

2444
03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:40.000
Now, six months ago we were shocked

2445
03:55:40.080 --> 03:55:44.200
to hear of the murder of Mohan Thakur,
founder of Tuckersoft.

2446
03:55:44.280 --> 03:55:48.520
Today, his murderer is behind bars.
But what went wrong?

2447
03:55:49.600 --> 03:55:52.920

I'd say...

if you could live your life again,
you should make some different choices.

2460

03:57:42.280 --> 03:57:43.120
Oh.

2477
03:57:46.840 --> 03:57:47.680
Ah.

2478
03:57:51.560 --> 03:57:55.600
And that's why, one day,
we might play games against each other

2479
03:57:55.680 --> 03:57:58.840
using our computers, and a telephone.

2480
03:57:59.360 --> 03:58:01.600
- Crispin.
- Thanks, Leslie.

2481
03:58:02.280 --> 03:58:04.640
Now, six months ago we were shocked

2482
03:58:04.720 --> 03:58:08.840
to hear of the murder of Mohan Thakur,
founder of Tuckersoft.

2483
03:58:08.920 --> 03:58:13.320
Today, his murderer is behind bars.
But what went wrong?

2484
03:58:14.080 --> 03:58:17.440
<i>In October of last year,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft was riding high</i>

2485
03:58:17.520 --> 03:58:20.120
<i>with a string of hits topping the charts,</i>

2486
03:58:20.200 --> 03:58:24.120
<i>and a mounting anticipation for their big</i>
<i>Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

2487
03:58:24.200 --> 03:58:26.400
<i>But Bandersnatch never appeared,</i>

2488
03:58:26.480 --> 03:58:30.000
<i>following the arrest and subsequent</i>
<i>murder charge against its creator,</i>

2489
03:58:30.080 --> 03:58:32.400
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

2490
03:58:32.480 --> 03:58:34.880
<i>who stands accused</i>
<i>of murdering his father</i>

2491
03:58:34.960 --> 03:58:38.160
<i>and Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

2492
03:58:38.240 --> 03:58:42.160
<i>Another Tuckersoft protégé,</i>
<i>famed programmer Colin Ritman,</i>

2493
03:58:42.240 --> 03:58:46.560
<i>believes there are important lessons</i>
<i>to be learned from Butler's unravelling.</i>

2494
03:58:47.320 --> 03:58:50.080
What would you say to Stefan,
if he could hear you?

2495
03:58:50.560 --> 03:58:51.840
I'd say...

2496
03:58:53.480 --> 03:58:57.560
if you could live your life again,
you should make some different choices.

2497
03:58:58.280 --> 03:59:00.320
But he can't live his life again.

2498
03:59:01.600 --> 03:59:02.760
<i>Come on, mate.</i>

2499
03:59:03.880 --> 03:59:05.240
<i>Dare to dream.</i>

2500
03:59:06.040 --> 03:59:08.760
<i>Shortly after this interview,</i>
<i>Colin Ritman was arrested</i>

2501
03:59:08.840 --> 03:59:11.280
<i>for possession of controlled substances.</i>

2502
03:59:11.360 --> 03:59:16.760
<i>Tuckersoft closed its doors for good.</i>
<i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

2503
03:59:22.440 --> 03:59:24.760
<i>How many times have you watched</i>
<i>Pac-Man die?</i>

2504
03:59:24.840 --> 03:59:27.520
<i>Doesn't bother him. He just tries again.</i>

2505
03:59:30.840 --> 03:59:31.880
Colin Ritman.

2506
03:59:33.480 --> 03:59:34.680
We've met before.

2507
03:59:35.160 --> 03:59:37.040
- No.
- We met before.

2508
03:59:37.120 --> 03:59:39.800
I told you I'd see you around,
and I was right.

2509
03:59:40.320 --> 03:59:44.280
Would you like to talk about
what happened with your mother?

2510
03:59:44.680 --> 03:59:46.440
<i>I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.</i>

2511
03:59:46.520 --> 03:59:48.400
- Are you coming or not?
- No!

2512
03:59:48.600 --> 03:59:50.680
<i>The 8:45 train derailed...</i>

2513
03:59:50.760 --> 03:59:52.600
<i>Mirrors let you move through time.</i>

2514
03:59:52.720 --> 03:59:54.760
He should've stopped playing
with dolls.

2515
03:59:54.840 --> 03:59:56.920
Sorry, look, I am going
to do something about this.

2516
04:01:06.040 --> 04:01:07.160
Are you Stefan?

2517
04:01:08.400 --> 04:01:09.240
Yes.

2518
04:01:10.240 --> 04:01:11.560
We've met before.

2519
04:01:12.160 --> 04:01:13.120
No, we haven't.

2520
04:01:13.760 --> 04:01:14.800
Do you know where Colin is?

2521
04:01:16.240 --> 04:01:17.080
No.

2522
04:01:18.840 --> 04:01:21.680
I was in the office
and Satpal said you'd seen him last.

2523
04:01:24.920 --> 04:01:27.000
If you know where he is, please tell me.

2524
04:01:31.640 --> 04:01:32.760
He jumped.

2525
04:01:34.320 --> 04:01:35.360
Jumped?

2526
04:01:36.400 --> 04:01:37.480
Jumped where, what?

2527
04:01:37.920 --> 04:01:40.080
Off the balcony. At your flat, and...

2528
04:01:41.400 --> 04:01:42.640
He jumped and then he fell and...

2529
04:01:43.440 --> 04:01:47.160
And you were there.
You were there. You saw the whole thing.

2530
04:01:47.520 --> 04:01:48.720
What are you on about?

2531
04:01:52.240 --> 04:01:55.600
I wasn't sure if it actually happened.

2532
04:01:56.880 --> 04:01:58.040
Are you on something?

2533
04:01:58.920 --> 04:02:02.640
No, no, no. I got rid of them.
The pills. I don't know why.

2534
04:02:05.720 --> 04:02:06.600
Right.

2535
04:02:08.280 --> 04:02:11.480
Well, if you hear from Colin,
tell him to ring Kitty.

2536
04:02:11.560 --> 04:02:12.440
OK. I've got to go.

2537
04:03:17.440 --> 04:03:19.480
And that's why futurologists believe

2538
04:03:19.560 --> 04:03:22.520
you'll be able to play
the games of the future anywhere.

2539
04:03:22.600 --> 04:03:27.280
On a bus, or the tube,
in the palm of your hand.

2540
04:03:28.040 --> 04:03:30.480
- Crispin.
- Thanks, Leslie.

2541
04:03:31.200 --> 04:03:35.160
Now, yesterday, following weeks
of controversy and speculation,

2542
04:03:35.240 --> 04:03:39.480
games company Tuckersoft announced
it's going into liquidation.

2543
04:03:39.920 --> 04:03:41.560
<i>So what went wrong?</i>

2544
04:03:42.240 --> 04:03:45.400
<i>Just six months ago,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

2545
04:03:45.480 --> 04:03:47.800

<i>and mounting anticipation for their big</i>
<i>Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

2547
04:03:52.240 --> 04:03:54.400
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

2548
04:03:54.480 --> 04:03:58.200
following the arrest and subsequent
murder charge against its creator,

2549
04:03:58.280 --> 04:04:00.440
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

2550
04:04:00.520 --> 04:04:02.920
<i>who stands accused</i>
<i>of murdering his father</i>

2551
04:04:03.000 --> 04:04:04.920
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

2552
04:04:05.000 --> 04:04:07.440
<i>This has raised questions</i>
<i>about the judgment</i>

2553
04:04:07.520 --> 04:04:10.400
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

2554
04:04:10.880 --> 04:04:13.720
It was his idea to do it alone.
His decision.

2555
04:04:13.800 --> 04:04:15.560
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

2556
04:04:15.920 --> 04:04:19.440
I mean, I know his dad's dead,
rest his soul,

2557
04:04:19.800 --> 04:04:23.320
but I'm a victim, too.
Let's try to not forget that.

2558
04:04:23.400 --> 04:04:27.560
<i>But there's another Tuckersoft</i>
<i>protégé at the center of a mystery.</i>

2559
04:04:27.920 --> 04:04:30.920
<i>Famed programmer Colin Ritman</i>
<i>is still missing,</i>

2560
04:04:31.000 --> 04:04:34.840
<i>having vanished without trace</i>
<i>shortly before the killings.</i>

2561
04:04:35.160 --> 04:04:37.640
<i>At the trial,</i>
<i>Butler denied any involvement</i>

2562
04:04:37.720 --> 04:04:39.960
<i>in Ritman's sudden disappearance,</i>

2563
04:04:40.040 --> 04:04:44.320
<i>claiming he had seen Ritman</i>
<i>committing suicide in a vision.</i>

2564
04:04:44.520 --> 04:04:47.720
<i>Today, Tuckersoft closed its doors</i>
<i>for good.</i>

2565
04:04:47.800 --> 04:04:50.800
<i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

2566
04:05:45.520 --> 04:05:46.800
Well, you need a hand.

2567
04:05:50.560 --> 04:05:52.360
Come on, lead me to it.

2568
04:05:53.800 --> 04:05:56.640
- To what?
- Bandersnatch.

2569
04:05:57.240 --> 04:05:59.160
Where's your pit? Up there?

2570
04:06:09.040 --> 04:06:10.480
Fucking hell.

2571
04:06:11.080 --> 04:06:12.920
You've gone right down the hole, mate.

2572
04:06:13.800 --> 04:06:15.040
Right down it.

2573
04:06:22.360 --> 04:06:23.480
I killed my dad.

2574
04:06:25.560 --> 04:06:26.680
Right.

2575
04:06:29.720 --> 04:06:32.160
So are you gonna let me go,
or are you gonna kill me?

2576
04:06:39.040 --> 04:06:40.400
I mean, it's your choice.

2577
04:06:41.440 --> 04:06:43.320
In as much as you have any choice.

2578
04:06:46.920 --> 04:06:47.760
I'm sorry.

2579
04:06:49.040 --> 04:06:52.120
Alright. No point arguing about it.

2580
04:06:52.600 --> 04:06:54.280
Not with that though. They sting.

2581
04:06:56.320 --> 04:06:57.560
You got anything blunt?

2582
04:07:01.840 --> 04:07:03.400
Stun me first.

2583
04:07:04.000 --> 04:07:05.360
Bit more humane.

2584
04:07:16.120 --> 04:07:17.040
Try this.

2585
04:07:27.080 --> 04:07:28.600
See you in the next life, yeah?

2586
04:07:38.720 --> 04:07:40.080
Come on, on me head.

2587
04:07:46.480 --> 04:07:48.160
That really is fascinating.

2588
04:07:48.240 --> 04:07:51.000
Although we've got many years to go
before virtual reality

2589
04:07:51.080 --> 04:07:52.920

04:11:36.200 --> 04:11:37.640
I chose for you.

2642
04:11:39.840 --> 04:11:41.080
Are you OK with that?

2643
04:11:42.280 --> 04:11:44.440
Yeah.

2644
04:12:12.120 --> 04:12:13.880
People think there's one reality

2645
04:12:13.960 --> 04:12:16.200
but there's loads of them,
all snaking off, like roots.

2646
04:12:16.280 --> 04:12:18.920
And what you do on one path
affects what happens on the other paths.

2647
04:12:19.160 --> 04:12:20.840
Time is a construct.

2648
04:12:20.920 --> 04:12:24.040
People think you can't go back
and change things, but you can.

2649
04:12:24.120 --> 04:12:25.400
That's what flashbacks are.

2650
04:12:25.480 --> 04:12:28.360
They're invitations to go back
and make different choices.

2651
04:12:28.440 --> 04:12:31.440
When you make a decision,
you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

2652
04:12:31.520 --> 04:12:34.280
It's the spirit out there
that's connected to our world

2653
04:12:34.480 --> 04:12:38.680
that decides what we do
and we just have to go along for the ride.

2654
04:12:39.720 --> 04:12:41.720
Mirrors let you move through time.

2655
04:12:42.200 --> 04:12:43.440
The government monitors people,

2656
04:12:44.040 --> 04:12:46.040
they pay people to pretend
to be your relatives,

2657
04:12:46.560 --> 04:12:49.240
and they put drugs in your food
and they film you

2658
04:12:49.720 --> 04:12:51.520
There's messages in every game.

2659
04:12:51.800 --> 04:12:54.240
Like Pac-Man,
do you know what PAC stands for?

2660
04:12:55.160 --> 04:12:57.480
P-A-C. Program and Control.

2661
04:12:57.560 --> 04:12:59.400
He's Program and Control Man.

2662
04:13:00.440 --> 04:13:01.400
The whole thing's a metaphor.

2663
04:13:01.680 --> 04:13:04.520
He thinks he's got free will
but really, he's trapped in a maze,

2664
04:13:04.760 --> 04:13:06.720
in a system, all he can do is consume,

2665
04:13:06.800 --> 04:13:09.080
he's pursued by demons
that are probably just in his own head.

2666
04:13:09.440 --> 04:13:12.160
And even if he does manage to escape
by slipping out one side of the maze,

2667
04:13:12.440 --> 04:13:14.600
what happens?
He comes right back in the other side.

2668
04:13:15.200 --> 04:13:16.480
People think it's a happy game,

2669
04:13:16.720 --> 04:13:19.520
it's not a happy game,
it's a fucking nightmare world

2670
04:13:19.600 --> 04:13:22.000
and the worst thing is
it's real and we live in it.

2671
04:13:22.320 --> 04:13:23.160
It's all a code.

2672
04:13:23.880 --> 04:13:26.040
If you listen closely,
you can hear the numbers.

2673
04:13:27.680 --> 04:13:30.280
There's a cosmic flowchart
that dictates where you can

2674
04:13:30.760 --> 04:13:32.360
and where you can't go.

2675
04:13:33.680 --> 04:13:36.640
I've given you the knowledge.
I've set you free.

2676
04:13:38.920 --> 04:13:40.040
Do you understand?

2677
04:13:42.280 --> 04:13:43.200
Maybe.

2678
04:13:44.720 --> 04:13:46.440
Yes. Sort of.

2679
04:13:46.800 --> 04:13:48.320
I'll show you what I mean.

2680
04:13:49.680 --> 04:13:50.520
Come with me.

2681
04:13:59.240 --> 04:14:00.880
We're on one path.

2682
04:14:01.560 --> 04:14:03.160
Right now, me and you.

2683
04:14:04.040 --> 04:14:06.640
And how one path ends is immaterial.

2684
04:14:06.880 --> 04:14:12.560
It's how our decisions along that path
affect the whole that matters.

2685
04:14:13.240 --> 04:14:14.440
Do you believe me?

2686
04:14:15.640 --> 04:14:19.760
- I don't know.
- I'll prove it.

2687
04:14:20.640 --> 04:14:23.880
One of us is going over.

2688
04:14:25.280 --> 04:14:26.320
Over there.

2689
04:14:30.680 --> 04:14:31.800
You'd die. You'd die.

2690
04:14:32.560 --> 04:14:36.680
It wouldn't matter
because there are other timelines, Stefan.

2691
04:14:37.400 --> 04:14:39.640
How many times have you watched
Pac-Man die?

2692
04:14:40.400 --> 04:14:41.720
Doesn't bother him.

2693
04:14:42.960 --> 04:14:44.400
He just tries again.

2694
04:14:45.280 --> 04:14:46.680
One of us is jumping.

2695
04:14:47.560 --> 04:14:48.920
So, who's it going to be?

2696
04:14:54.520 --> 04:14:56.200
There's a nice breeze up here.

2697
04:14:59.560 --> 04:15:00.560
So come on.

2698
04:15:02.040 --> 04:15:03.560
Which one of us is jumping?

2699
04:15:11.440 --> 04:15:14.560
So, that's how
the wireframe models of today

2700
04:15:14.640 --> 04:15:17.760
might provide the Hollywood entertainment
of the future.

2701
04:15:17.960 --> 04:15:20.160
- Crispin.
- Thanks, Leslie.

2702
04:15:20.840 --> 04:15:24.800
Now, yesterday, following weeks
of controversy and speculation,

2703
04:15:24.880 --> 04:15:28.880
games company Tuckersoft announced
it's going into administration.

2704
04:15:28.960 --> 04:15:30.200
<i>So, what went wrong?</i>

2705
04:15:30.840 --> 04:15:34.000
<i>Just six months ago,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

2706
04:15:34.080 --> 04:15:36.400
<i>with a string of hits topping the charts</i>

2707
04:15:36.480 --> 04:15:40.480
<i>and mounting anticipation for their big</i>
<i>Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

2708
04:15:40.840 --> 04:15:43.000
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

2709
04:15:43.080 --> 04:15:46.560
following the arrest and subsequent
murder charge against its creator,

2710
04:15:46.640 --> 04:15:49.040
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

2711
04:15:49.120 --> 04:15:51.440
<i>who stands accused</i>
<i>of murdering his father</i>

2712
04:15:51.520 --> 04:15:53.520
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

2713
04:15:53.600 --> 04:15:56.080
<i>This has raised questions</i>
<i>about the judgment</i>

2714
04:15:56.160 --> 04:15:59.000
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

2715
04:15:59.480 --> 04:16:02.320
It was his idea to do it alone.
His decision.

2716
04:16:02.400 --> 04:16:04.160
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

2717
04:16:04.520 --> 04:16:08.040
I mean, I know his dad's dead,
rest his soul,

2718
04:16:08.400 --> 04:16:12.040
but I'm a victim, too.
Let's try to not forget that.

2719
04:16:12.480 --> 04:16:16.520
<i>Another Tuckersoft protégé,</i>
<i>famed programmer Colin Ritman,</i>

2720
04:16:16.600 --> 04:16:21.040
<i>believes there are important lessons</i>
<i>to be learned from Butler's unravelling.</i>

2721
04:16:21.600 --> 04:16:24.160
What would you say to Stefan,
if he could hear you?

2722
04:16:25.320 --> 04:16:26.800
I'd say try again.

2723
04:16:27.760 --> 04:16:28.840
But he's in prison.

2724
04:16:29.880 --> 04:16:31.560
<i>Only in this life.</i>

2725
04:16:32.120 --> 04:16:34.800
<i>Shortly after this interview,</i>
<i>Colin Ritman was arrested</i>

2726
04:16:34.880 --> 04:16:37.120
<i>for possession of controlled substances.</i>

2727
04:16:37.200 --> 04:16:42.760
<i>Tuckersoft closed its doors for good.</i>
<i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

2728
04:16:58.360 --> 04:17:01.120
How's that for entertainment,
you psychiatric fuck?

2729
04:17:02.040 --> 04:17:04.200
Fucked your day up
good and proper, didn't we?

2730
04:17:04.280 --> 04:17:07.000
Me and my friend from the future!

2731
04:17:14.960 --> 04:17:18.680
With that in mind, I think it's important
you stay on the pharmaceutical path

2732
04:17:18.760 --> 04:17:20.200
at least for the next few months.

2733
04:17:20.640 --> 04:17:23.120
I'm upping the dosage slightly.

2734
04:17:25.640 --> 04:17:26.800
Stefan.

2735
04:17:27.560 --> 04:17:28.920
Don't see this as a setback.

2736
04:17:29.880 --> 04:17:32.120
You're not alone. We're in it together.

2737
04:17:33.360 --> 04:17:36.520
One for all, and all...

2738
04:17:38.800 --> 04:17:39.680
For one.

2739
04:17:43.960 --> 04:17:46.760
If anything happens, just call me.

2740
04:17:47.200 --> 04:17:48.440
You know the number.

2741
04:17:54.960 --> 04:17:55.920
How was it?

2742
04:17:57.400 --> 04:17:58.400
It was fine.

2743
04:18:00.040 --> 04:18:02.120
Breathe. In, out.

2744
04:18:03.000 --> 04:18:04.280
Breathe.

2745
04:18:19.160 --> 04:18:21.440
- No.
- No?

2746
04:18:23.240 --> 04:18:24.440
The boy's a clown.

2747
04:18:24.800 --> 04:18:26.280
Well, tough tit-holes.

2748
04:18:26.360 --> 04:18:28.480
You signed a contract,
so don't be a pillock.

2749
04:18:28.560 --> 04:18:29.640
<i>Do you want me go down there?</i>

2750
04:18:29.720 --> 04:18:33.960
Pull your finger out.
I expect it by the end of today. Sayonara!

2751
04:18:37.760 --> 04:18:40.480
- Never rush an artist.
- Oh, blow it out your bumhole.

2752
04:18:41.560 --> 04:18:44.720
He needs to explore all possibilities.
All realities.

2753
04:18:45.040 --> 04:18:47.640
How about a reality
where you get your feet off my table?

2754
04:18:49.120 --> 04:18:51.960
Fucking "no." I'll show him fucking "no."

2755
04:19:05.040 --> 04:19:09.080
We're going to be a hit factory.
Like Motown, but for computer games.

2756
04:19:09.160 --> 04:19:11.160
- You heard it here first.
- Colin Ritman.

2757
04:19:12.160 --> 04:19:13.080
We've met before.

2758
04:19:13.160 --> 04:19:14.640
- What's your answer?
- No.

2759
04:19:14.720 --> 04:19:17.760
Well done, mate. Speak to Dr. Haynes
about it, and listen to her.

2760
04:19:17.840 --> 04:19:20.960
- Well done, Stefan.
- You sound like my dad.

2761
04:19:21.480 --> 04:19:22.320
Oh.

2762
04:19:23.080 --> 04:19:27.600
Would you like to talk about
what happened with your mother?

2763
04:19:34.040 --> 04:19:36.680
It can be helpful to revisit things.

2764
04:19:36.760 --> 04:19:39.160
Even if you feel like
you've done this before.

2765
04:19:40.800 --> 04:19:44.120
You might discover something new.

2766
04:19:48.440 --> 04:19:49.840
- Your Bander-what?
- Bandersnatch.

2767
04:19:49.920 --> 04:19:51.280
Is that your mother's?

2768
04:19:51.760 --> 04:19:53.800
Like Motown,
but for computer games.

2769
04:19:53.880 --> 04:19:56.800
- Colin Ritman.
- We've met before.

2770
04:19:56.880 --> 04:19:58.320
- What's your answer?
- No.

2771
04:19:58.400 --> 04:20:00.520
- Bit of madness is what you need.
- It was too...

2772
04:20:00.600 --> 04:20:02.080
- Too?
- Good to be true.

2773
04:20:02.160 --> 04:20:04.200
- Are you coming or not?
- No!

2774
04:20:04.280 --> 04:20:06.280
Because of me
she had to catch a later train.

2775
04:20:06.360 --> 04:20:09.480
<i>The 8:45 train derailed</i>
<i>at high speed...</i>

2776
04:20:13.160 --> 04:20:16.600
Stefan, I'm worried about you,
you've been stuck in your room for weeks.

2777
04:20:22.880 --> 04:20:24.000
Stefan.

2778
04:20:24.920 --> 04:20:26.040
Will you talk to me?

2779
04:20:30.480 --> 04:20:32.760
Look, I can't help if you just sit there
and don't speak!

2780
04:20:36.800 --> 04:20:39.720
- Motown for computer games.
- Colin Ritman.

2781
04:20:40.680 --> 04:20:42.400
- We've met before.
- What's your answer?

2782
04:20:42.480 --> 04:20:43.800
Bit of madness is what you need.

2783
04:20:43.880 --> 04:20:45.960
- Are you coming or not?
- No!

2784
04:20:46.040 --> 04:20:48.080
Because of me
she had to catch a later train.

2785
04:20:48.160 --> 04:20:50.000
<i>The 8:45 train derailed...</i>

2786
04:20:50.800 --> 04:20:52.560
Stefan, will you talk to me?

2787
04:20:52.640 --> 04:20:54.200
Dad, just fuck off!

2788
04:20:56.000 --> 04:20:58.600
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

2789
04:21:00.800 --> 04:21:03.480
Motown for computer games.
You heard it here first.

2790
04:21:03.560 --> 04:21:04.680
Colin Ritman.

2791
04:21:05.640 --> 04:21:06.480
We've met before.

2792
04:21:06.560 --> 04:21:07.920
- It was too...
- Too?

2793
04:21:08.000 --> 04:21:09.560
- Good to be true.
- Oh.

2794
04:21:09.640 --> 04:21:11.680
- Are you coming or not?
- No!

2795
04:21:11.760 --> 04:21:13.400
<i>The 8:45 derailed...</i>

2796
04:21:14.040 --> 04:21:15.520
Dad, just fuck off!

2797
04:21:15.600 --> 04:21:17.840
My head is all over the place.
I'm not in control.

2798
04:21:18.680 --> 04:21:20.920
Don't see this as a setback.
We're in it together.

2799
04:21:22.120 --> 04:21:24.120

Colin Ritman.

We've met before.

2803
04:21:32.880 --> 04:21:34.240
- It was too...

2804
04:21:34.320 --> 04:21:35.840
- Good to be true.
- Oh.

<i>Doesn't bother him. He just tries again.</i>

3020
04:37:08.840 --> 04:37:12.880
We're going to be a hit factory
like Motown, but for computer games.

3021
04:37:12.960 --> 04:37:13.840
You heard it here first.

So, come on, what's your answer?

3038
04:38:00.880 --> 04:38:02.880
A bit of madness is what you need.

3039
04:38:02.960 --> 04:38:04.520
Stefan, will you talk to me?

3040
04:38:04.600 --> 04:38:06.160
Dad, just fuck off!

3041
04:38:07.160 --> 04:38:08.320
Get your coat.

3042
04:38:09.280 --> 04:38:12.360
- This is Dr. Haynes' place.
